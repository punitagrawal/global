.SH NAME
gtags \- create tag files for global.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgtags\fP [-ciIOqvw][-d \fItag-file\fP][-f \fIfile\fP][\fIdbpath\fP]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGtags\fP is used to create tag files for \fBglobal\fP(1).
.PP
\fBGtags\fP recursively collects source files under the current directory,
picks up symbols and writes the cross-reference data into the tag files
(\'GTAGS\', \'GRTAGS\' and \'GPATH\').
.PP
If \'gtags.files\' exists or the \fB-f\fP option is specified,
target files are limited by it. Lines starting with \'. \' are comments.
.PP
C, yacc, Assembly, Java, C++ and PHP source files are supported.
Files whose names end in \'.c\', \'.h\' are assumed to be C source files.
Files whose names end in \'.y\' are assumed to be yacc source files.
Files whose names end in \'.s\', \'.S\' are assumed to be Assembly source files.
Files whose names end in \'.java\' are assumed to be Java source files.
Files whose names end in \'.c++\', \'.cc\', \'.hh\', \'.cpp\', \'.cxx\', \'.hxx\', \'.hpp\', \'.C\', \'.H\' are assumed to be C++ source files.
Files whose names end in \'.php\', \'.php3\', \'.phtml\' are assumed to be PHP source files.
Other files are assumed to be text files. Gtags does not treat binary files.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.PP
.TP
\fB--accept-dotfiles\fP
Accept files and directories whose names begin with a dot.
By default, \fBgtags\fP ignores them.
.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--compact\fP
Make \'GTAGS\' in compact format.
This option does not influence \'GRTAGS\',
because that is always made in compact format.
.TP
\fB--config\fP[=\fIname\fP]
Print the value of config variable \fIname\fP.
If \fIname\fP is not specified then print all names and values.
.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--dump\fP \fItag-file\fP
Dump a tag file as text to the standard output. Output format is 'key<tab>data'.
This is for debugging.
.TP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--file\fP \fIfile\fP
Browse through all files whose names are listed in \fIfile\fP.
The argument \fIfile\fP can be set to \'-\' to accept a list of
files from the standard input.
File names must be separated by newline.
.TP
\fB--gtagsconf\fP \fIfile\fP
Set environment variable \fBGTAGSCONF\fP to \fIfile\fP.
.TP
\fB--gtagslabel\fP \fIlabel\fP
Set environment variable \fBGTAGSLABEL\fP to \fIlabel\fP.
.TP
\fB-I\fP, \fB--idutils\fP
In addition to tag files, make ID database for \fBidutils\fP(1).
.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--incremental\fP
Update tag files incrementally.
It's better to use \fBglobal\fP(1) with the \fB-u\fP command.
.TP
\fB-O\fP, \fB--objdir\fP
Use BSD-style objdir as the location of tag files.
If \'$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\' directory exists, \fBgtags\fP creates
\'$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX/<current directory>\' directory and makes
tag files in it.
If \fIdbpath\fP is specified, this option is ignored.
.TP
\fB--single-update\fP \fIfile\fP
Update tag files for a single file.
It is considered that \fIfile\fP was added or updated,
and there is no change in other files.
This option implies the \fB-i\fP option.
.TP
\fB--statistics\fP
Print statistics information.
.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP
Quiet mode.
.TP
\fB-v\fP, \fB--verbose\fP
Verbose mode.
.TP
\fB-w\fP, \fB--warning\fP
Print warning messages.
.TP
\fIdbpath\fP
The directory in which tag files are generated.
The default is the current directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
$ ls -F
Makefile      src/    lib/
$ gtags -v
$ global -x main
main              10 src/main.c  main (argc, argv) {
.fi
.SH FILES
.TP
\'GTAGS\'
Tag file for definitions.
.TP
\'GRTAGS\'
Tag file for references.
.TP
\'GPATH\'
Tag file for source files.
.TP
\'$HOME/.globalrc\', \'gtags.conf\'
\fBGtags\fP load a configuration file according to the following
priority (Lower number means higher priority).
.nf
(1) $GTAGSCONF
(2) [project root]/gtags.conf
(3) $HOME/.globalrc
(4) /etc/gtags.conf
(5) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf
.fi
.TP
\'gtags.files\'
The list of candidates of target files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of \fBgtags\fP:
.PP
.TP
\fBGTAGSCACHE\fP
The size of the B-tree cache. The default is 50000000 (bytes).
.TP
\fBGTAGSCONF\fP
Configuration file. The default is \'$HOME/.globalrc\'.
.TP
\fBGTAGSFORCECPP\fP
If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is \'.h\' is treated
as a C++ source file.
.TP
\fBGTAGSLABEL\fP
Configuration label. The default is \'default\'.
.TP
\fBGTAGSLOGGING\fP
If this variable is set, \'$GTAGSLOGGING\' is used as the path name
of a log file. There is no default value.
.TP
\fBGTAGS_OPTIONS\fP
The value of this variable is inserted in the head of arguments.
.TP
\fBMAKEOBJDIR\fP
If this variable is set, \'$MAKEOBJDIR\' is used as the name
of BSD-style objdir. The default is \'obj\'.
.TP
\fBMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\fP
If this variable is set, \'$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\' is used as the prefix
of BSD-style objdir. The default is \'/usr/obj\'.
.TP
\fBTMPDIR\fP
The location used to stored temporary files. The default is \'/tmp\'.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The following configuration variables affect the execution of \fBgtags\fP.
You can see the default value for each variable with the \fB--config\fP option.
.PP
.TP
gtags_parser (comma separated list)
Specify the mapping of language names and plug-in parsers.
Each part delimited by the comma consists of the language name, a colon,
the shared object path, an optional colon followed by a function name.
If the function name is not specified, 'parser' is assumed.
As a special exception, \fBgtags\fP collects values
from multiple gtags_parser variables.
.TP
icase_path (boolean)
Ignore case distinctions in the path.
Suffixes check is affected by this capability.
.TP
langmap (comma separated list)
Language mapping. Each comma-separated map consists of
the language name, a colon, and a list of file extensions.
As a special exception, \fBgtags\fP collects values
from multiple langmap variables.
Default mapping is:
.br
\'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.hh.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml\'.
.TP
skip (comma separated list)
\fBGtags\fP skips files and directories which are given in this list.
As a special exception, \fBgtags\fP collects values from multiple
skip variables.
If the value ends with \'/\', it is assumed as a directory and
\fBgtags\fP skips all files under it.
The value may include glob patterns (*, ?, [...], [!...], [^...]).
If the value starts with \'/\', it is assumed a relative path name
from the root directory of the project. You cannot use glob patterns
for a path name.
.PP
Addition to these, the variables listed in the ENVIRONMENT section except for
GTAGSCONF and GTAGSLABEL are also available as configuration variables.
Each environment variable is given more priority than configuration variable 
of the same name.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBGtags\fP exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBglobal\fP(1),
\fBhtags\fP(1).
.PP
GNU GLOBAL source code tag system
.br
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global/).
.SH BUG
\'GTAGS\' and \'GRTAGS\' are very large.
In advance of using this command, check the space of your disk.
.PP
Assembly support is far from complete.
It extracts only ENTRY() and ALTENTRY() from source file.
Probably valid only for FreeBSD and Linux kernel source.
.PP
There is no concurrency control about tag files.
