global (6.6.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  Enable build with universal ctags.

global (6.5.7-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting from 6.5.7-2, global data files that were previously placed
  in /usr/share/gtags have moved to /usr/share/global/gtags. The new
  location is chosen to align with debian convention of files being
  placed in folders named after the package "global". The moved files
  relate to assets required for browsing cross-referenced source code
  tags generated with htags.

  Users of htags should regnerate the tags to update the html to pick
  assets from the new location.

global (6.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  This is a significant upgrade of GNU Global - it uses an upstream
  release ~8.5 years ahead of the previous packaged version. It brings
  with it many bug fixes, improvements and features added to upstream
  over that period.

  As from any major upgrade, features have been evolving over upstream
  releases - in particular htags functionality to support generation
  of system cgi-bin scripts has been removed. As a result, debian
  specific tools - htmake and htconfig - built on (but also providing
  alternative to) the above are no longer available. If you use these
  tools or rely on htags' system cgi-bin functionality, please look at
  README.debian for alternatives.
