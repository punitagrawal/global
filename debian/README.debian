	GLOBAL for Debian
	-----------------

See /usr/share/doc/global/README.gz and README.htmake.gz or the
global.info and relevant man pages for general usage details.

The Debian version of GLOBAL has been configured to use a
centralised cgi search mechanism which I developed for it.
If you want to generate searchable html source but don't
like to have .htaccess files or cgi execution enabled all
over the place, then consider using 'htmake' in place of
'htags' to generate your hypertext source.  See the htmake
manual page for details.

I've also added a -C option for htags which produces gzipped
html files with a suffix of html.gz -- This makes use of the
ghtml.cgi file unnecessary for Debian systems, as they should
decompress html.gz files transparently.

(UPDATE: FreeBSD (the upstream authors platform) does not
presently deal with html.gz files the same way that Debian
does, hence htags -c option creates .ghtml files by default.
The -C option has been added as a convenience for Debian
users, but this facility may be implemented differently
in the future.  An alternate option for Debian users is
to specify html.gz as the default suffix in a global.conf
file which will override the suffix created with -c, but
be aware that this may raise platform dependency issues
in cross platform environments.  We hope this issue will
be cleanly resolved in the future.) 

UPDATE-UPDATE: This issue is confused a little more, since
mozilla no longer does a sane thing by default with html.gz
(though lynx still does), while Debian apache will happily
decompress both html.gz and .ghtml on the fly, so either
way you do not need a helper cgi there.  The -C option
still supresses its generation, while -c does not.

In the ./examples directory you should find:

 - The gtags.vim plugin.
 - Patches and a helper script for nvi.
 - An example of the optional gtags.conf file.

The globash.rc is now installed in /etc and may be invoked
via the globash(1) wrapper.

Enjoy!
