global (5.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fall back to localhost if `hostname --fqdn` fails.
    This shouldn't usually happen, but may in some corner cases,
    and the postinst shouldn't abort if it does.  Closes: #541322
  * Extra deps for the Lenny info trigger transition.

global (5.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #378514, #387592, #430604
  * Add the prefix GNU in the package description.  It was actually BSD global
    when that description was first written, but if it makes it just a little
    less ambiguous to search for, then why not.  Closes: #385303

global (4.8.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

    seem to choke on that.

global (4.8.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #262250, #318848
  * Update to policy 2.6.2.1 and DH_COMPAT 4.
  * global.info is now monolithic, drop the * again.
  * gctags is dead, replaced by gtags-parser, and htags has been
    reimplemented in C.  Performance gains are alleged.
    Tentatively Closes: #159901, get back to me if pain persists.
  * Suggest doxygen (>=1.4.3) as it can now use global as its
    source browser.
  * Include vim plugin and other goodies with examples.
  * Don't build 'gnusort', use the system one.
  * Add zero space breaks '\:' to long lines in the man pages.
  * Fixes problem with --style-sheet option.  The original
    reporter's example will not actually work as he might have
    anticipated, but this clearly still Closes: #182187
    which I could reproduce in 4.5-1.
  * Install globash.rc in /etc with a couple of minor tweaks,
    and a wrapper to call it in /usr/bin, with simple man page.
    Noted in info docs.
