    Tentatively Closes: #159901, get back to me if pain persists.
  * Suggest doxygen (>=1.4.3) as it can now use global as its
    source browser.
  * Include vim plugin and other goodies with examples.
  * Don't build 'gnusort', use the system one.
  * Add zero space breaks '\:' to long lines in the man pages.
  * Fixes problem with --style-sheet option.  The original

    anticipated, but this clearly still Closes: #182187

    and a wrapper to call it in /usr/bin, with simple man page.
