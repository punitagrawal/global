1 Overview of this tool
***********************

1.1 What is GNU GLOBAL?
=======================

GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
diverse environments, such as Emacs editor, Vi editor, Less viewer, Bash
shell, various web browsers, etc.  You can locate specified symbols,
such as functions, macros, structs and classes in your source files and
move there easily.  It is useful for hacking large projects which
contain many sub-directories, many '#ifdef' and many 'main()' functions.
It is similar to ctags or etags, but is different from them at the point
of independence of any editor.

1.2 Concept of project
======================

GNU GLOBAL can treat a source tree containing sub-directories as a
project.  Anywhere in the project, you can utilize a high performance
tag database.  You need not specify where the database is, as global(1)
locates it by itself.  Because of this feature, you can move freely in a
project, and in and out of many projects.

1.3 Features
============

GNU GLOBAL has the following features:

   * supports C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP4 and assembly.

   * works the same way across diverse environments like follows:

        - Shell command line
        - Bash shell
        - Vi editor (Nvi, Elvis, vim)
        - Less viewer
        - Emacs editor (Emacs, Mule, Xemacs)
        - Web browser
        - Doxygen documentation system

   * finds locations of specified symbol quickly.

   * locates not only definitions but also references.

   * allows duplicate tags.

   * locates paths which matches to the specified pattern.

   * hierarchical searches by default.

   * searches not only in a source project but also in library projects.

   * generates completion list for completing input method.

   * supports various output formats.

   * allows customizing of a set of candidate files to be tagged.

   * understands POSIX 1003.2 regular expression.

   * supports idutils as an external search engine.

   * tag files are independent of machine architecture.

   * supports incremental updating of tag files.

   * plug-in parser is available to treat new language.

   * supports customizing using 'gtags.conf'.

   * generates a hypertext of source code.

   * compact format to save disk space.

   * supports client/server environment (TRAMP ready).

   * ignores binary files, dot files and specified files.

   * includes cscope-compatible program (gtags-cscope).

   * includes grep-like command (-g command).

   * supports grep-like symbol highlighting.

2.1 Preparation
===============

Before beginning, please read the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file.

         $ more /usr/local/share/gtags/FAQ

   First of all, you must execute gtags(1) (*note gtags::) at the root
of the source tree.  For example, if you want to browse the source code
of Vi editor in FreeBSD, please move to the source directory and invoke
gtags(1).

         $ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/vi
         $ gtags

   Gtags traverses sub-directories, picks up symbols from the source
files and makes three tag files at the current directory.  After this,
all files and directories under the current directory are treated as a
project.

         $ ls G*
         GPATH   GRTAGS  GTAGS

   * 'GTAGS'    definition database
   * 'GRTAGS'   reference database
   * 'GPATH'    path name database

   You should prepare for considerable disk space for tag files.  For
example, Linux-2.6.32 source code requires the following disk space.

         source code(Linux-2.6.32)       390MB

         GPATH                             6MB
         GTAGS                            81MB
         GRTAGS                          202MB
         -------------------------------------
         total of tag files              289MB

2.2 Basic usage
===============

Consider the following source tree:

     /home/user/
      |
      |-ROOT/      <- the root of source tree (GTAGS,GRTAGS,...)
         |
         |- README       .....   +---------------+
         |                       |The function of|
         |                       +---------------+
         |- DIR1/
         |  |
         |  |- fileA.c   .....   +---------------+
         |  |                    |main(){        |
         |  |                    |       func1();|
         |  |                    |       func2();|
         |  |                    |}              |
         |  |                    +---------------+
         |  |
         |  |- fileB.c   .....   +---------------+
         |                       |func1(){ ... } |
         |                       +---------------+
         |- DIR2/
            |
            |- fileC.c   .....   +---------------+
                                 |#ifdef X       |
                                 |func2(){ i++; }|
                                 |#else          |
                                 |func2(){ i--; }|
                                 |#endif         |
                                 |func3(){       |
                                 |       func1();|
                                 |}              |
                                 +---------------+

   * Once you make tag files at the root directory of a project, you can
     invoke global(1) from anywhere in the project.  By default, you get
     relative paths of the located files.

              $ cd /home/user/ROOT
              $ global func1
              DIR1/fileB.c            # func1() is defined in fileB.c
              $ cd DIR1
              $ global func1
              fileB.c                 # relative path from DIR1
              $ cd ../DIR2
              $ global func1
              ../DIR1/fileB.c         # relative path from DIR2

     You can use global(1) only when you are in a project.  If you are
     out of any project, it shows an error message like follows:

              $ cd /home/user
              $ global func1
              global: GTAGS not found.

   * The '-r' option locates references.

              $ global -r func2
              ../DIR1/fileA.c         # func2() is referred from fileA.c

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.

              $ cd /home/user/ROOT
              $ global 'func[1-3]'
              DIR1/fileB.c            # func1, func2 and func3 are matched
              DIR2/fileC.c

   * The '-x' option shows details.  It is similar to the '-x' option of
     ctags(1).

              $ global func2
              DIR2/fileC.c
              $ global -x func2
              func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i++; }
              func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c       func2(){ i--; }

   * The '-a' option produces absolute path names.

              $ global -a func1
              /home/user/ROOT/DIR1/fileB.c

   * The '-s' command locates symbols which are not defined in 'GTAGS'.

              $ global -xs X
              X                  1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

   * The '-g' command locates lines which have the specified pattern.

              $ global -xg '#ifdef'
              #ifdef             1 DIR2/fileC.c #ifdef X

     It is similar to egrep(1) but is far more convenient for source
     code reading, because it allows you to search through a project,
     and only in source files.

     Additionally, you can use various options:

     '-O'
          search only in text files.

     '-o'
          search in both source files and text files.

     '-l'
          search only under the current directory.

     The '-e', '-G' and '-i' options are available too.  The usage is
     almost same as egrep(1).

     You can even change the output format of global(1) to grep style
     using '--result=grep' option.  Of course, these options can be used
     even by other commands.

   * The '-P' command locates path names which include the specified
     pattern.

              $ global -P fileB
              DIR1/fileB.c
              $ global -P '1/'
              DIR1/fileA.c
              DIR1/fileB.c
              $ global -P '\.c$'
              DIR1/fileA.c
              DIR1/fileB.c
              DIR2/fileC.c

   * The '-f' command prints a list of tags in the specified file(s).

              $ global -f DIR2/fileC.c
              func2              2 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i++; }
              func2              4 DIR2/fileC.c   func2(){ i--; }
              func3              6 DIR2/fileC.c   func3(){

   * The '-l' option limits the range of retrieval under the current
     directory.

              $ cd DIR1
              $ global -xl func[1-3]
              func1        1 fileB.c      func1(){...}

2.3 Applied usage
=================

   * You can customize a set of candidate files to be tagged.

              $ find . -type f -print >/tmp/list     # make a file set
              $ vi /tmp/list                         # customize the file set
              $ gtags -f /tmp/list

   * If your source files are on a read-only device, such as CDROM, then
     you cannot make tag files at the root of the source tree.  In such
     case, you can make tag files in another place using 'GTAGSROOT'
     environment variable.

              $ mkdir /var/dbpath
              $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
              $ gtags /var/dbpath             # make tag files in /var/dbpath
              $ export GTAGSROOT=`pwd`
              $ export GTAGSDBPATH=/var/dbpath
              $ global func

     There is another method for it.  Since global(1) locates tag files
     also in '/usr/obj' + <current directory>, you can setup like
     follows: It is 'obj' directory.

              $ cd /cdrom/src                 # the root of source tree
              $ mkdir -p /usr/obj/cdrom/src
              $ gtags /usr/obj/cdrom/src      # make tag files in /usr/obj/cdrom/src
              $ global func

     The '-O, --objdir' option does it automatically for you.

     The path of obj directory can be changed by environment variable
     'MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX'.

   * If you want to locate symbols that are not defined in the source
     tree, then you can specify library directories with 'GTAGSLIBPATH'
     environment variable.

     You should execute gtags(1) at each directory in the
     'GTAGSLIBPATH'.  If 'GTAGS' is not found there, global ignores such
     directories.

              $ pwd
              /develop/src/mh                 # this is a source project
              $ gtags
              $ ls G*TAGS
              GRTAGS  GTAGS
              $ global mhl
              uip/mhlsbr.c                    # mhl() is found
              $ global strlen                 # strlen() is not found
              $ (cd /usr/src/lib; gtags)      # library source
              $ (cd /usr/src/sys; gtags)      # kernel source
              $ export GTAGSLIBPATH=/usr/src/lib:/usr/src/sys
              $ global strlen
              ../../../usr/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c  # found in library
              $ global access
              ../../../usr/src/sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c   # found in kernel


     Or, you can take a more straightforward way to do the same thing.
     In the following example, we treat as if the system library and the
     kernel are part of our project.

              $ ln -s /usr/src/lib .
              $ ln -s /usr/src/sys .
              $ gtags
              $ global strlen
              lib/libc/string/strlen.c
              $ global access
              sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c

   * If you forget symbol names, you can use the '-c' (complete)
     command.

              $ global -c kmem                # maybe k..k.. kmem..
              kmem_alloc
              kmem_alloc_pageable
              kmem_alloc_wait
              kmem_free
              kmem_free_wakeup
              kmem_init
              kmem_malloc
              kmem_suballoc                   # This is what I need!
              $ global kmem_suballoc
              ../vm/vm_kern.c

   * You can use the '-c' command with the complete command in the
     shell.

     In Bash:

              $ funcs()
              > {
              >         local cur
              >         cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
              >         COMPREPLY=(`global -c $cur`)
              > }
              $ complete -F funcs global
              $ global kmem_<TAB><TAB>
              kmem_alloc           kmem_alloc_wait      kmem_init
              kmem_alloc_nofault   kmem_free            kmem_malloc
              kmem_alloc_pageable  kmem_free_wakeup     kmem_suballoc
              $ global kmem_s<TAB>
              $ global kmem_suballoc
              ../vm/vm_kern.c

     If you like input completion, you should try globash (*note
     GloBash::).  It supports you in a suitable way without any
     preparation.

   * You can edit all files which have specified tags by typing one
     command.  For example:

              $ vi `global func1`     # edit fileB.c

   * If you want to browse many files in order, do the following:

              $ global -xr fork | awk '{printf "view +%s %s\n",$2,$3}'
              view +650 ../dev/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_asm.c
              view +250 ibcs2/ibcs2_misc.c
              view +401 linux/linux_misc.c
              view +310 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +318 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +336 ../kern/init_main.c
              view +351 ../kern/init_main.c
              $ !! | sh            # from now on, go to next tag with 'ZZ'.

         GloBash needs a working directory. Do you create '/home/you/.globash'? ([y]/n)

   Pressing the <ENTER> key, you will see a prompt as follows:

         [/usr/src/sys]/kern _

   This prompt means that the current directory is '/usr/src/sys/kern'
and the root directory of the project is '/usr/src/sys'.  Tag and marker
are valid only in a project.

   When you try to go out of the project, globash warns like:

         [/usr/src/sys] cd ..
         You are going to get out of the current project.
         Tag stack and marker will be removed. Sure? ([y]/n)_

   If you answer 'y <RET>' or just <RET> then the tag stack and marker
(described later) will be removed.

   If you need help then please type 'ghelp'.

3.1.3 Usage
-----------

   * Most of global(1)'s (*note global::) command characters are
     available as commands.

              [/usr/src/sys] x fork           <- (global -x fork)
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] r                <- (global -xr fork)
              >    1  fork              85 alpha/linux/linux_machdep.c
                   2  fork             184 i386/linux/linux_machdep.c
              [/usr/src/sys] s lbolt          <- (global -xs lbolt)
              >    1  lbolt            1210 i386/isa/wd_cd.c     tsleep((cad
                   2  lbolt            1211 i386/isa/wd_cd.c     tsleep((cad
                   3  lbolt            709 i386/isa/wfd.c     tsleep ((caddr
              ...
              [/usr/src/sys] g                <- (global -xg lbolt)
              >    1  lbolt            1210 i386/isa/wd_cd.c     tsleep((cad
              ...
              [/usr/src/sys] P init           <- (global -xP init)
              >    1  path    1 dev/hea/eni_init.c
                   2  path    1 dev/hfa/fore_init.c
                   3  path    1 i386/i386/initcpu.c
                   4  path    1 kern/init_main.c
                   5  path    1 kern/init_sysent.c
                   6  path    1 kern/vfs_init.c
                   7  path    1 vm/vm_init.c
              [/usr/src/sys] _

     If no argument is specified then the latest argument is used.

   * Input completion facility is available.  For each command, suitable
     completion is applied.

              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_<TAB><TAB>
              kmem_alloc          kmem_free           kmem_malloc
              kmem_alloc_nofault  kmem_free_wakeup    kmem_object
              kmem_alloc_wait     kmem_init           kmem_suballoc
              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_s<TAB>
              [/usr/src/sys] x kmem_suballoc

   * You can select a tag by 'show' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] show 3
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     The default editor is vi(1).  You can specify it statically by
     'EDITOR' environment variable or temporarily by options.

              [/usr/src/sys] show -e 3
              (Preloaded emacs show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] show -l 3
              (Load less and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] show -g 3
              (Preloaded mozilla show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     Otherwise, you can use the following commands (with abbreviated
     form):

     'list (l)'
          print tag list.

     'first'
          go to the first tag.

     'last'
          go to the last tag.

     'next (n)'
          go to the next tag.

     'prev (p)'
          go to the previous tag.

     'show N (1,2,3,..,999)'
          go to Nth tag

   * You can use vi-like tag stack.  You can return to the previous tag
     list by the 'pop' or 'CTRL-T' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] show 3
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] x fork           <- push new tag on the tag stack.
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] pop              <- pop tag stack.
              [/usr/src/sys] show
              (Load editor and show boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c at line 227.)

     You can print the current tag stack with 'tags' command.

   * You can remember tags using the 'mark' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] x fork
              >    1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] mark
              [/usr/src/sys] x main
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....
              [/usr/src/sys] mark -l          <- show marker list.
                   1  fork              94 kern/kern_fork.c fork(p, uap)
              [/usr/src/sys] mark 1           <- select a marker.
              (Load editor and show kern/kern_fork.c at line 227.)
              [/usr/src/sys] list
              >    1  main              70 alpha/alpha/gensetdefs.c main(in
                   2  main             1500 alpha/alpha/ieee_float.c main(i
                   3  main             227 boot/alpha/boot1/boot1.c main()
              ....

     Marked tags are valid until you go out of the current project or
     quit the current bash(1) session.

   * You can remember directories using the 'cookie' command, and return
     there using the 'warp' command.

              [/usr/src/sys] cookie           <- drop a cookie.
              [/usr/src/sys] cd kern
              [/usr/src/sys]/kern cookie      <- drop a cookie again.
              [/usr/src/sys]/kern cd ../i386
              [/usr/src/sys]/i386 cookie -l   <- show cookie list.
                   1  /usr/src/sys/kern
                   2  /usr/src/sys
              [/usr/src/sys]/i386 warp 2      <- warp to the selected cookie.
              [/usr/src/sys] _

     Cookie directories are valid until you delete them.

3.2 Less using GLOBAL
=====================

You can use GLOBAL as a tag system of less(1) viewer instead of ctags.

* Menu:

* Features(Less)::                       Features.
* Preparation(Less)::                    Preparation.
* Usage(Less)::                          Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(Less),  Next: Preparation(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from less(1) viewer.
   * Less viewer supports duplicated tag.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Less),  Next: Usage(Less),  Prev: Features(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global.  *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from less(1), you need to set environment
variable 'LESSGLOBALTAGS' to 'global'.

         $ export LESSGLOBALTAGS=global


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Less),  Prev: Preparation(Less),  Up: Less viewer

3.2.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to 'func1', you can say

              $ less -t func1

     Please note that if 'tags' exists in the current directory then
     less(1) uses it.  If you want to use 'GTAGS' even if 'tags' exists
     then please specify the tag file explicitly like this:

              $ less -TGTAGS -t func1

   * To go to the referenced point of 'func1', please specify 'GRTAGS'.

              $ less -TGRTAGS -t func1

     In the same way, you can use 'GTAGS', 'GRTAGS' or 'GPATH' as tag
     files.

   * If a number of tags are located, less(1) goes to the first tag.
     You can go to next tag by typing 't' and back by typing 'T'.

     't'
          go to next tag.
     'T'
          go to previous tag.

   * In a less(1) session, you can use the ':t' command to locate a new
     symbol.  But in this case, you cannot change the tag file from the
     one specified by the '-T' option.

   * With the '-T-' option, less(1) reads standard input as a tag file.
     You can connect global and less(1) with a pipe.  It is very
     convenient.

              $ global -x func | less -T-

     In the same way, you can use the following command lines:

              # pattern match with grep(1).
              $ global -xg 'lseek(.*)' | less -T-

              # pattern match with idutils(1).
              $ global -xI func | less -T-

              # all definitions in *.c.
              $ global -f *.c | less -T-

              # all files including 'init' in their path.
              $ global -Px init | less -T-

   * If your editor doesn't support GLOBAL directly then you can use
     less(1) as a footstool.

              # invoke less
              $ less -t main
              main(int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c (tag 1 of 55)]

              # type 'v'(vi) command in less session.
              v

              # load vi and show the same position.
              .....
              main((int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c 313 lines, 7783 char]

              # type 'ZZ' command in vi session.
              ZZ

              # exit vi and back to less session.
              main(int argc, char **argv)
              {
              int i;
              .....
              [xxx/main.c (tag 1 of 55)]

File: global.info,  Node: Features(Nvi-1.81.5),  Next: Preparation(Nvi-1.81.5),  Up: Nvi-1.81.5 editor

3.3.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from Nvi.
   * Intelligent recognition of the current token and its type.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Nvi-1.81.5),  Next: Usage(Nvi-1.81.5),  Prev: Features(Nvi-1.81.5),  Up: Nvi-1.81.5 editor

3.3.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global.  *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from Nvi, you need to write to '.nexrc' like
this.  It is assumed that 'gtags.pl' is put in '$HOME/perl'.

         $HOME/.nexrc
         +----------------------------
         |perl use lib "$ENV{'HOME'}/perl"
         |perl require 'gtags.pl'
         |map ^P :tagprev^M
         |map ^N :tagnext^M
         |map ^] :perl tag^M
         |ab gtag perl tag qw(
         |ab gta perl tag qw(
         |ab gt perl tag qw(

   You must start Nvi in a project as described in *note Preparation::.


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Nvi-1.81.5),  Prev: Preparation(Nvi-1.81.5),  Up: Nvi-1.81.5 editor

3.3.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to 'func1', you can say

              :perl tag qw(func1)

     Suggested .nexrc:
              ab gtag perl tag qw(
              ab gta perl tag qw(
              ab gt perl tag qw(

   * To go to the referenced point of 'func1', add the option '-r'

              :perl tag qw(-r func1)

   * If a number of tags are located, Nvi goes to the first tag.  You
     can go to next tag by typing ':tagnext' and back by typing
     ':tagprev'.

     Suggested .nexrc:
              map ^N :tagnext^M
              map ^P :tagprev^M

   * If you don't specify any argument, ':perl tag' command does the
     following:

     If the context of the current token is a definition then it is
     equivalent to ':perl tag qw(-r CURRENT-TOKEN)'.  Otherwise, if it
     is a reference to some definitions then it is equivalent to ':perl
     tag qw(CURRENT-TOKEN)' else it is equivalent to ':perl tag qw(-s
     CURRENT-TOKEN)'.

     Suggested .nexrc:
              map ^] :perl tag^M

     It is similar to 'CTRL-]' command.

   * You can use the '-s' option; it locates symbols which are not
     defined in 'GTAGS'.

              :perl tag qw(-s pat)

   * The '-g', '-f' and '-P' options are also available.  It works like
     the command line.

              :perl tag qw(-g pat)

   * When you want to locate tags the name of which start with 'set' or
     'get', use:

              :perl tag qw(^[sg]et)

   * Other tag commands are also available:

     'CTRL-T'
          return to the most recent tag location.

     ':tagpop'
          return to the most recent tag location.

     ':tagtop'
          return to the top of the tag stack.

     ':display tags'
          display the tags stack.


File: global.info,  Node: Elvis editor,  Next: Vim editor,  Prev: Nvi-1.81.5 editor,  Up: Applications

3.4 Elvis using GLOBAL
======================

Elvis 2.1 or later has two variables, 'tagprg' and 'tagprgonce', for
running an external tag search program.  You can use them for GLOBAL.

* Menu:

* Features(Elvis)::                     Features.
* Preparation(Elvis)::                  Preparation.
* Usage(Elvis)::                        Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(Elvis),  Next: Preparation(Elvis),  Up: Elvis editor

3.4.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from Elvis.
   * Mouse is supported.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Elvis),  Next: Usage(Elvis),  Prev: Features(Elvis),  Up: Elvis editor

3.4.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global.  *Note Preparation::.

   Second, start Elvis and execute 'set tagprg="global -t $1"' like
this:

         $ elvis
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         ~
         :set tagprg="global -t $1"


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Elvis),  Prev: Preparation(Elvis),  Up: Elvis editor

3.4.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to 'func1', you can say

              :tag func1

     It seems the same as original Elvis, but Elvis executes 'global -t
     func1' internally and read the output instead of tags file.

   * To go to the referenced point of 'func1', add '-r' option.

              :tag -r func1

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in 'GTAGS', try this:

              :tag -s lbolt

   * To locate strings, try this:

              :tag -g Copyright

   * When a lot of results are expected, it's better to use the browse
     command.

              :browse -r fork

     It brings a following selection list.  You can select a tag line
     and go to the point.

              Browse -r fork (2 matches)
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------
              | TAG NAME       | SOURCE FILE    | SOURCE LINE
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------
              |fork            |ux/linux_misc.c | (line 565)
              |fork            |ern/init_main.c | (line 191)
              +----------------+----------------+--------------------

   * To get a list of tags in specified files, use the '-f' command.

              :browse -f main.c               <- locate definitions in main.c

   * Other tag commands are also available:

     'CTRL-]'
          go to the definition of the current token.

     'CTRL-T'
          return to the most recent tag context.

     ':tag'
          without argument, go to the next tag.

     ':pop'
          return to the most recent tag context.

     ':stack'
          display the tags stack.

     ':stag'
          create a new window and move its cursor to the tag's
          definition point.

     ':sbrowse'
          same as 'browse' but show in a new window.

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.

              :tag ^put_                  <- locate tags start with 'put_'

              :browse -g 'fseek(.*L_SET)' <- locate fseek() using L_SET argument

   * You can browse tag's list of many files.

              :browse -f *.c              <- locate tags in *.c

   * You can browse the files whose path includes specified pattern.

              :browse -P /vm/             <- under vm/ directory
              :browse -P \.h$             <- all include files
              :browse -P init             <- path including 'init'

   * You can use mouse for tag operations.

     If you have a mouse, then you can use the left button to
     double-click on a word in the text, to have Elvis perform a ':tag'
     search on that word.  Double-clicking the right button anywhere in
     the text will perform a ':pop' command.

     In the selection list of the 'browse' command, you can use the left
     button to double-click on a tag name, to have Elvis select the tag.
     To come back, double-click the right button.

3.5 Vim using GLOBAL
====================

In Vim 6.2 or later, you can use the 'gtags.vim' script.

* Menu:

* Features(Vim)::                       Features.
* Preparation(Vim)::                    Preparation.

File: global.info,  Node: Features(Vim),  Next: Preparation(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from Vim.
   * Intelligent recognition of the current token and its type.
   * Special characters '%', '#' and input completion are available.

   To our regret, the tag stack facility is not available.  If you want
to use the facility, please try gtags-cscope.  *Note Gtags-cscope::.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Vim),  Next: Usage(Vim),  Prev: Features(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global.  *Note Preparation::.

   Second, copy 'gtags.vim' to your plug-in directory or source it from
your vimrc.

         $ cp /usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.vim $HOME/.vim/plugin


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Vim),  Prev: Preparation(Vim),  Up: Vim editor

3.5.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to 'main', you can say

              :Gtags main

     Vim executes global(1), parses the output, lists located tags in
     quickfix window and loads the first entry.  The quickfix window is
     like this:

          gozilla/gozilla.c|200| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-cscope/gtags-cscope.c|124| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-parser/asm_scan.c|2056| int main()
          gtags-parser/gctags.c|157| main(int argc, char **argv)
          gtags-parser/php.c|2116| int main()
          gtags/gtags.c|152| main(int argc, char **argv)
          [Quickfix List]

     You can go to any entry using quickfix command.

     ':cn'
          go to the next entry.

     ':cp'
          go to the previous entry.

     ':ccN'
          go to the N'th entry.

     ':cl'
          list all entries.

     You can see the help of quickfix like this:

              :h quickfix

     Suggested map:
              map <C-n> :cn<CR>
              map <C-p> :cp<CR>

   * To go to the referenced point of 'func1', add the '-r' option.

              :Gtags -r func1

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in 'GTAGS', try this:

              :Gtags -s lbolt

   * To locate strings, try this:

              :Gtags -g int argc

              :Gtags -g "root"

              :Gtags -ge -C               <- locate '-C'

   * To get a list of tags in specified files, use the '-f' command.

              :Gtags -f main.c            <- locate tags in main.c

     If you are editing 'main.c' itself, you can use '%' instead.

              :Gtags -f %                 <- locate tags in main.c

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.

              :Gtags ^put_              <- locate tags starting with 'put_'

              :Gtags -g fseek(.*SEEK_SET) <- locate fseek() using SEEK_SET

   * Input completion is available.

     In the command line, press 'CTRL-D' after some typing and Vim will
     show a list of tag names that start with the string.  Press <TAB>
     and Vim will complete the tag name.

              :Gtags fu<TAB>

              :Gtags func1                <- 'nc1' is appended by vim

   * You can browse files whose path includes specified pattern.

              :Gtags -P /vm/              <- under vm/ directory
              :Gtags -P \.h$              <- all include files
              :Gtags -P init              <- path including 'init'

   * You can use all options of global(1) except for '-c -n -p -q -u -v'
     and all long name options.  They are sent to global(1) as is.  For
     example:

              :Gtags -gi paTtern        <- matches both 'PATTERN' and 'pattern'

              :Gtags -POi make          <- matches Makefile but not makeit.c

     About the other options, please see *note global::.

   * The GtagsCursor command brings you to the definition or reference
     of the current token.

     If the context of the current token is a definition then it is
     equivalent to ':Gtags -r CURRENT-TOKEN'; if it is a reference to
     some definitions then it is equivalent to ':Gtags CURRENT-TOKEN';
     else it is equivalent to ':Gtags -s CURRENT-TOKEN'.

              :GtagsCursor

     Suggested map:
              map <C-\>^] :GtagsCursor<CR>

     Though the mapping of ':GtagsCursor' to '^]' seems suitable, it
     will bring an inconvenience in the help screen.

   * If you have the hypertext generated by htags(1) then you can
     display the same part of the source code in the mozilla browser.
     Let's load mozilla and try this:

              :Gozilla

     Suggested map:
              map <C-g> :Gozilla<CR>

   * If you want to load Vim with all main()s then following command
     line is useful.

              $ vim '+Gtags main'

3.6 Extended Emacs using GLOBAL
===============================

You can use GLOBAL as the tag system of Emacs editor instead of etags.

* Menu:

* Features(Emacs)::                     Features.
* Preparation(Emacs)::                  Preparation.

File: global.info,  Node: Features(Emacs),  Next: Preparation(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.1 Features
--------------

   * You can use most of GLOBAL's facilities from the editor.
   * More intelligent recognition of the current token and its type.
   * Tag completion is available for input tag name.
   * Mouse is supported.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(Emacs),  Next: Usage(Emacs),  Prev: Features(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.2 Preparation
-----------------

First, do the preparation of global.  *Note Preparation::.

   Second, to use global from Emacs, you need to load the 'gtags.el' and
execute 'gtags-mode' function in it.

   Write the call to autoload function to your '$HOME/.emacs', start
Emacs and execute 'gtags-mode' function.  If you put 'gtags.el' in a
directory other than the standard macro directory, you need to add it to
'load-path'.

         $HOME/.emacs
         +------------------------------------------------------
         |(setq load-path (cons "/home/owner/global" load-path))
         |(autoload 'gtags-mode "gtags" "" t)

         $ emacs

         |
         |J_:-----Mule: *scratch*       (Lisp Interaction)--L16--All----
         |M-x gtags-mode[RET]
         +------------------------------------------------------

   If you want to get into gtags-mode whenever you get into c-mode then
you can append the following code to your '$HOME/.emacs'.

           (setq c-mode-hook
               '(lambda ()
                   (gtags-mode 1)
           ))

   About key mappings, please see the comment of gtags.el.


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(Emacs),  Prev: Preparation(Emacs),  Up: Emacs editor

3.6.3 Usage
-----------

   * To go to 'func1', invoke 'gtags-find-tag' and you can see a prompt
     in the mini-buffer.  Then input the tag name.

              Find tag: func1			<- 'Find tag: ' is a prompt

   * To go to the referenced point of 'func1', invoke 'gtags-find-rtag'.

              Find tag (reference): func1

   * Tag name completion is available.

              Find tag: fuTAB

              Find tag: func1                     <- 'nc1' is appended by emacs

   * If a number of tags are located, Emacs goes into "GTAGS SELECT
     MODE" like this:


              +-------------------------------------------------------------
              |main             347 i386/isa/ultra14f.c main()
              |main             128 kern/init_main.c   main(framep)
              |main             104 netiso/clnp_debug.c main()
              |main             164 netiso/xebec/main.c main(argc, argv)
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |
              |J_:--%*-Mule: *scratch*       (Gtags Select)--L1--All----
              |[GTAGS SELECT MODE] 4 lines
              +-------------------------------------------------------------

     Please select a tag line by any Emacs command and press <RET>, and
     you can go to the tag's point.  When you want to go to the next or
     previous tag, please return to the above mode with
     'gtags-pop-stack' and reselect.

     You can customize the path style in this mode by setting
     'gtags-path-style' variable.

     'root'
          relative from the root of the project (Default)

     'relative'
          relative from the current directory

     'absolute'
          absolute (relative from the system root directory)

     There are two methods to set this variable:

        * You can change it dynamically using the 'customize' command of
          Emacs.  You will find the entry in the Programming/Tools/Gtags
          group.

        * You can change it when Emacs is loaded using '.emacs' file
          like this:

                   (setq gtags-mode-hook
                     '(lambda ()
                       (setq gtags-path-style 'relative)))

   * 'gtags-find-tag-from-here' command is available.

     If current token is a definition, it is equivalent to 'Find tag
     (reference): CURRENT-TOKEN<RET>', otherwise it is equivalent to
     'Find tag: CURRENT-TOKEN<RET>'.

   * To locate symbols which are not defined in 'GTAGS', try
     'gtags-find-symbol'.

              Find symbol: lbolt          <- 'Find symbol:' is a prompt

   * To locate strings, try 'gtags-find-with-grep'.

              Find pattern: Copyright

   * You can use POSIX regular expressions.

              Find tag: ^put_             <- locate tags starting with 'put_'

   * Mouse command is available.

     If you use X version Emacs, try the following:

     Move the mouse cursor to a symbol name and click the middle button,
     and you can go to the point of the definitions, or to its
     references, depending on the context.  In 'GTAGS SELECT MODE', move
     the mouse cursor to a line and click the center button.

     To return to the previous position, click the right button.

3.7 Gtags-cscope
================

You can also use cscope as a client of GNU GLOBAL. GLOBAL package
includes a command named 'gtags-cscope' which is a port of cscope, that
is, it is cscope itself except that it use GLOBAL as a search engine
instead of cscope's one.


     $ gtags-cscope


   Its function is available from vim editor.  Please input like follows
in the command mode.

     :set csprg=gtags-cscope
     :cs add GTAGS

   After this, you can use built-in 'cs find' commands in the Vim
editor.  Though the deceit is not perfect ('cs find d' is not
implemented), this method might be more convenient than 'gtags.vim' in
that you can use the tag stack facility of Vim.

3.8 Hypertext generator
=======================

You can use GLOBAL's facilities from web browsers.

* Menu:

* Features(browser)::                   Features.
* Preparation(browser)::                Preparation.
* Usage(browser)::                      Usage.


File: global.info,  Node: Features(browser),  Next: Preparation(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.1 Features
--------------

   * Htags makes a hypertext from C, C++, Yacc and Java source files.
   * Once the hypertext is generated, you need nothing other than a web
     browser.
   * You can move the hypertext to anywhere; it is independent of the
     source code.
   * You can use all of your browser's functions, such as search,
     history, bookmark, save, frames, windows, etc.


File: global.info,  Node: Preparation(browser),  Next: Usage(browser),  Prev: Features(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.2 Preparation
-----------------

At first, you must ensure that you have a lot of disk space for
hypertext.  For example, Linux-2.6.32 source code (390MB) requires 4-6
GB of disk space.

         source code(Linux-2.6.32)            390MB
         GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS                   289MB

         hypertext (with no option)           3.8GB
         hypertext (with --suggest option)    5.7GB

   Please invoke gtags(1) (*note gtags::) and htags(1) (*note htags::)
in order like this:

         (at the root directory of your source project)
         $ gtags                 # make tag files(GPATH,GTAGS,GRTAGS)
         $ htags                 # make hypertext(HTML/)

   Then you will find a directory named 'HTML' in the current directory.

   Htags has rich options.  If you are new on htags then you are
recommended to use the '--suggest' option.  This option makes some
popular options effective, and invokes gtags(1) if there is no tag
files.

         $ htags --suggest

   If HTTP server is available then the '-D' and '-f' options are also
useful.


File: global.info,  Node: Usage(browser),  Prev: Preparation(browser),  Up: Web browser

3.8.3 Usage
-----------

Please start a web browser like this:

         $ lynx HTML/index.html

   You will understand the usage by looking at the examples.

   You can move the HTML directory to anywhere.  It is independent of
the source code as long as CGI facility is not used.

   Using mozilla, you can also utilize the hypertext from your command
line like this:

         $ mozilla                           # load mozilla
         $ global -x main
         main        10 main.c main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
         $ gozilla +10 main.c                # usage is similar to vi editor.
         (show main.c at 10 on mozilla's screen.)

   But in this case, you must not move the HTML directory from the
source directory.


File: global.info,  Node: Doxygen documentation system,  Prev: Web browser,  Up: Applications

3.9 Doxygen using GLOBAL
========================

You can use GLOBAL as the source browser of Doxygen.

   Doxygen Release 1.4.3 or later has config option 'USE_HTAGS'.  When
enabled in combination with 'SOURCE_BROWSER=YES', htags(1) is used as
the source browser instead of Doxygen's own.

   Here is an example.

     (in source directory)
     $ doxygen -g
     $ vi Doxyfile
     +---------------------------------
     |...
     |INPUT                  = .
     |RECURSIVE              = YES
     |SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
     |USE_HTAGS              = YES

4.1 How to configure GLOBAL
===========================

You can customize GLOBAL using configuration file.

         # cp gtags.conf /etc/gtags.conf         # system wide config file.
         # vi /etc/gtags.conf

         $ cp gtags.conf $HOME/.globalrc         # personal config file.
         $ vi $HOME/.globalrc

   If '$HOME/.globalrc' exists then GLOBAL uses it; else if
'/etc/gtags.conf' exists then GLOBAL uses it; otherwise default value is
used.  The format of 'gtags.conf' resembles termcap(5).  By default,
'default' target is used.  About the capabilities, please see each
command manual.  *Note Reference::.


File: global.info,  Node: Plug-in,  Next: Incremental updating,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Other topics

4.2 Plug-in parser
==================

You can write a new parser for gtags(1).

   Command layer plug-in parser was abolished.  Please write function
layer plug-in parser instead.  See 'plugin-factory/' to discover the
function layer plug-in parser.

   You can use Exuberant ctags as a plug-in parser too.  This requires
Exuberant ctags version 5.5 or later.

         # Installation of GLOBAL
         # It assumed that ctags command is installed in '/usr/local/bin'.

         $ ./configure --with-exuberant-ctags=/usr/local/bin/ctags
         $ make
         $ sudo make install

         # Executing of gtags
         # It assumed that GLOBAL is installed in '/usr/local'.

         $ export GTAGSCONF=/usr/local/share/gtags/gtags.conf
         $ export GTAGSLABEL=ctags
         $ gtags                         # gtags invokes Exuberant Ctags internally


File: global.info,  Node: Incremental updating,  Prev: Plug-in,  Up: Other topics

4.3 Incremental updating
========================

Modifying some source files, you need not remake the entire tag files.
Instead, you can use incremental updating facility ('-u' option).

         $ gtags
         $ cd kernel
         $ vi user.c                             # modify user.c

5.1 global - print locations of given symbols
=============================================

NAME
----

global - print locations of given symbols

SYNOPSIS
--------

     global [-adEFGilMnqrstTvx][-S dir][-e] pattern
     global -c[dFiIMoOPrsT] prefix
     global -f[adlnqrstvx][-L file-list][-S dir] files
     global -g[aEGilMnoOqtvVx][-L file-list][-S dir][-e] pattern [files]
     global -I[ailMnqtvx][-S dir][-e] pattern
     global -P[aEGilMnoOqtvVx][-S dir][-e] pattern
     global -p[qrv]
     global -u[qv]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Global finds locations of given symbols in C, C++, Yacc, Java, PHP and
Assembly source files, and prints the path name, line number and line
image of the locations.  Global can locate not only definitions but also
references and other symbols.

   Global can treat a source tree, that is, a directory that has
sub-directories and source files, as a project.  In advance of using
this command, you must execute gtags(1) at the root directory of the
project which you want to investigate to make tag files.  Then you can
use global command anywhere in the project.  You need not specify where
the tag file is.  Instead, global locates it by itself.

   You can specify a regular expression for pattern.  Global understands
two different versions of regular expression syntax: basic and extended
(default).

COMMANDS
--------

The following commands are available:

<no command> pattern
     Print tags which match to pattern.  By default, print definition
     tags.
'-c', '--completion' [prefix]
     Print symbols which start with prefix.  If prefix is not given,
     print all symbols.
'-f', '--file' files
     Print all tags in the files.  This command implies the '-x' option.
'-g', '--grep' pattern [files]
     Print all lines which match to the pattern.  If files are given,
     this command searches in those files.
'--help'
     Print a usage message.
'-I', '--idutils' pattern
     Print all lines which match to pattern.  This function uses
     idutils(1) as a search engine.  To use this command, you need to
     install idutils(1) in your system and execute gtags(1) with the
     '-I' option.
'-P', '--path' [pattern]
     Print path names which match to pattern.  If no pattern is given,
     print all paths in the project.
'-p', '--print-dbpath'
     Print location of 'GTAGS'.
'-u', '--update'
     Update tag files incrementally.  This command internally invokes
     gtags(1).  You can execute this command anywhere in the project,
     differing from gtags(1).
'--version'
     Show version number.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:

'-a', '--absolute'
     Print absolute path names.  By default, print relative path names.
'--color' when
     Use color to highlight the pattern within the line; when may be one
     of: never, always or auto (default).  The default color is bold red
     text on current background; the environment variable GREP_COLORS or
     GREP_COLOR defines it.  This option is effective to the following
     commands: <no command>, -f, -g, -I, -P.
'-d', '--definition'
     Print locations of definitions.
'-e', '--regexp' pattern
     Use pattern as the pattern; useful to protect patterns starting
     with '-'.
'-E', '--extended-regexp'
     Interpret pattern as a extended regular expression.  This is the
     default.
'--encode-path' chars
     Convert path characters in chars into a '%' symbol, followed by the
     two-digit hexadecimal representation of the character.  A blank
     will be converted to '%20'.
'-F', '--first-match'
     End the search without go through all the tag files listed in
     GTAGSLIBPATH when tags are found in a tag file.  This is the
     default.
'--from-here' context
     Decide tag type by context, which must be 'lineno:path'.  If this
     option is specified then '-s' and '-r' are ignored.  Regular
     expression is not allowed for pattern.  This option assumes use in
     conversational environments such as editors and IDEs.
'-G', '--basic-regexp'
     Interpret pattern as a basic regular expression.  The default is an
     extended regular expression.
'--gtagsconf' file
     Set environment variable GTAGSCONF to file.
'--gtagslabel' label
     Set environment variable GTAGSLABEL to label.
'-i', '--ignore-case'
     Ignore case distinctions in the pattern.
'-L', '--file-list' file
     Obtain files from file in addition to the arguments.  The argument
     file can be set to '-' to accept a list of files from the standard
     input.  File names must be separated by newline.
'-l', '--local'
     Print only tags which exist under the current directory.
'--literal'
     Execute literal search instead of regular expression search.  This
     option is only valid when the '-g' command is specified.
'-M', '--match-case'
     Search is case-sensitive.  This is the default.
'--match-part part'
     Specify how path name completion should match, where part is one
     of: 'first', 'last' or 'all' (default).  This option is valid only
     with the '-c' command in conjunction with '-P'.
'-n', '--nofilter'
     Suppress sort filter and path conversion filter.
'-O', '--only-other'
     Treat only text files other than source code, like 'README'.  This
     option is valid only with the '-g' or '-P' command.  This option
     overrides the '-o' option.
'-o', '--other'
     Treat not only source files but also text files other than source
     code, like 'README'.  This option is valid only with the '-g' or
     '-P' command.
'--path-style' format
     Print path names using format, which may be one of: 'relative',
     'absolute', 'shorter', 'abslib' or 'through'.  The '--path-style'
     option is given more priority than the '-a' option.
'--print0'
     Print each record followed by a null character instead of a
     newline.
'-q', '--quiet'
     Quiet mode.
'-r', '--reference', '--rootdir'
     Print reference tags.  Reference means the reference to a symbol
     which has definitions.  With the '-p' option, print the root
     directory of the project.
'--result' format
     Print out using format, which may be one of: 'path' (default),
     'ctags', 'ctags-x', 'grep' or 'cscope'.  The '--result=ctags' and
     '--result=ctags-x' options are equivalent to the '-t' and '-x'
     options respectively.  The '--result' option is given more priority
     than the '-t' and '-x' options.
'--single-update' file
     Update tag files using gtags(1) with the '--single-update' option.
     It is considered that file was added or updated, and there is no
     change in other files.  This option implies the '-u' option.
'-s', '--symbol'
     Print other symbol tags.  Other symbol means the reference to a
     symbol which has no definition.
'-S', '--scope' dir
     Print only tags which exist under dir directory.  It is similar to
     the '-l' option, but you need not change directory.
'-T', '--through'
     Go through all the tag files listed in GTAGSLIBPATH.  By default,
     stop searching when tag is found.  This option is ignored when
     either '-s', '-r' or '-l' option is specified.
'-t', '--tags'
     Use standard ctags format.
'-V', '--invert-match'
     Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.  This
     option is valid only with the '-g' or '-P' commands.
'-v', '--verbose'
     Verbose mode.
'-x', '--cxref'
     Use standard ctags cxref (with '-x') format.

FILES
-----

'GTAGS'
     Tag file for definitions.
'GRTAGS'
     Tag file for references.
'GPATH'
     Tag file for source files.
'GTAGSROOT'
     If environment variable GTAGSROOT is not set and file 'GTAGSROOT'
     exists in the same directory as 'GTAGS' then global sets GTAGSROOT
     to the contents of the file.
'$HOME/.globalrc', 'gtags.conf'
     Global load a configuration file according to the following
     priority (Lower number means higher priority).
          		(1) $GTAGSCONF
          		(2) [project root]/gtags.conf
          		(3) $HOME/.globalrc
          		(4) /etc/gtags.conf
          		(5) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The following environment variables affect the execution of global:

GREP_COLOR
     The color to use for '--color'; GREP_COLORS has precedence.
GREP_COLORS
     The color (mt or ms) to use for '--color'; see grep(1).
GLOBAL_OPTIONS
     The value of this variable is inserted in the head of arguments.
GTAGSBLANKENCODE
     If this variable is set, the '--encode-path=" <TAB>"' option is
     specified.
GTAGSCACHE
     The size of the B-tree cache.  The default is 50000000 (bytes).
GTAGSCONF
     Configuration file.  The default is '$HOME/.globalrc'.
GTAGSDBPATH
     The directory in which the tag files exist.  This value is ignored
     when GTAGSROOT is not defined.  Use of this variable is not
     recommended.
GTAGSFORCECPP
     If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is '.h' is treated
     as a C++ source file.
GTAGSLABEL
     Configuration label.  The default is default.
GTAGSLIBPATH
     If this variable is set, it is used as the path to search for
     library functions.  If the given symbol is not found in the
     project, global also searches in these paths.  Since only 'GTAGS'
     is targeted in the retrieval, this variable is ignored when '-r' or
     '-s' is specified.
GTAGSLOGGING
     If this variable is set, '$GTAGSLOGGING' is used as the path name
     of a log file.  There is no default value.
GTAGSROOT
     The root directory of the project.  Usually, it is recognized by
     existence of 'GTAGS'.  Use of this variable is not recommended.
GTAGSTHROUGH
     If this variable is set, the '-T' option is specified.
MAKEOBJDIR
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIR' is used as the name of
     BSD-style objdir.  The default is 'obj'.
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the prefix
     of BSD-style objdir.  The default is '/usr/obj'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The following configuration variables affect the execution of global:

'icase_path' (boolean)
     Ignore case distinctions in pattern.

   Addition to these, the variables listed in the ENVIRONMENT section
except for GTAGSCONF, GTAGSLABEL, GTAGSROOT and GTAGSDBPATH are also
available as configuration variables.  Each environment variable is
given more priority than configuration variable of the same name.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

Global exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

5.2 gtags - create tag files for global.
========================================

NAME
----

gtags - create tag files for global.

SYNOPSIS
--------

     gtags [-ciIOqvw][-d tag-file][-f file][dbpath]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gtags is used to create tag files for global(1).

   Gtags recursively collects source files under the current directory,
picks up symbols and writes the cross-reference data into the tag files
('GTAGS', 'GRTAGS' and 'GPATH').

   If 'gtags.files' exists or the '-f' option is specified, target files
are limited by it.  Lines starting with '. ' are comments.

   C, yacc, Assembly, Java, C++ and PHP source files are supported.
Files whose names end in '.c', '.h' are assumed to be C source files.
Files whose names end in '.y' are assumed to be yacc source files.
Files whose names end in '.s', '.S' are assumed to be Assembly source
files.  Files whose names end in '.java' are assumed to be Java source
files.  Files whose names end in '.c++', '.cc', '.hh', '.cpp', '.cxx',
'.hxx', '.hpp', '.C', '.H' are assumed to be C++ source files.  Files
whose names end in '.php', '.php3', '.phtml' are assumed to be PHP
source files.  Other files are assumed to be text files.  Gtags does not
treat binary files.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:

'--accept-dotfiles'
     Accept files and directories whose names begin with a dot.  By
     default, gtags ignores them.
'-c', '--compact'
     Make 'GTAGS' in compact format.  This option does not influence
     'GRTAGS', because that is always made in compact format.
'--config'[=name]
     Print the value of config variable name.  If name is not specified
     then print all names and values.
'-d', '--dump' tag-file
     Dump a tag file as text to the standard output.  Output format is
     'key<tab>data'.  This is for debugging.
'-f', '--file' file
     Browse through all files whose names are listed in file.  The
     argument file can be set to '-' to accept a list of files from the
     standard input.  File names must be separated by newline.
'--gtagsconf' file
     Set environment variable GTAGSCONF to file.
'--gtagslabel' label
     Set environment variable GTAGSLABEL to label.
'-I', '--idutils'
     In addition to tag files, make ID database for idutils(1).
'-i', '--incremental'
     Update tag files incrementally.  It's better to use global(1) with
     the '-u' command.
'-O', '--objdir'
     Use BSD-style objdir as the location of tag files.  If
     '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' directory exists, gtags creates
     '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX/<current directory>' directory and makes tag
     files in it.  If dbpath is specified, this option is ignored.
'--single-update' file
     Update tag files for a single file.  It is considered that file was
     added or updated, and there is no change in other files.  This
     option implies the '-i' option.
'--statistics'
     Print statistics information.
'-q', '--quiet'
     Quiet mode.
'-v', '--verbose'
     Verbose mode.
'-w', '--warning'
     Print warning messages.
dbpath
     The directory in which tag files are generated.  The default is the
     current directory.

EXAMPLES
--------

     	$ ls -F
     	Makefile      src/    lib/
     	$ gtags -v
     	$ global -x main
     	main              10 src/main.c  main (argc, argv) {

FILES
-----

'GTAGS'
     Tag file for definitions.
'GRTAGS'
     Tag file for references.
'GPATH'
     Tag file for source files.
'$HOME/.globalrc', 'gtags.conf'
     Gtags load a configuration file according to the following priority
     (Lower number means higher priority).
          		(1) $GTAGSCONF
          		(2) [project root]/gtags.conf
          		(3) $HOME/.globalrc
          		(4) /etc/gtags.conf
          		(5) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf
'gtags.files'
     The list of candidates of target files.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

The following environment variables affect the execution of gtags:

GTAGSCACHE
     The size of the B-tree cache.  The default is 50000000 (bytes).
GTAGSCONF
     Configuration file.  The default is '$HOME/.globalrc'.
GTAGSFORCECPP
     If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is '.h' is treated
     as a C++ source file.
GTAGSLABEL
     Configuration label.  The default is 'default'.
GTAGSLOGGING
     If this variable is set, '$GTAGSLOGGING' is used as the path name
     of a log file.  There is no default value.
GTAGS_OPTIONS
     The value of this variable is inserted in the head of arguments.
MAKEOBJDIR
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIR' is used as the name of
     BSD-style objdir.  The default is 'obj'.
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the prefix
     of BSD-style objdir.  The default is '/usr/obj'.
TMPDIR
     The location used to stored temporary files.  The default is
     '/tmp'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The following configuration variables affect the execution of gtags.
You can see the default value for each variable with the '--config'
option.

'gtags_parser' (comma separated list)
     Specify the mapping of language names and plug-in parsers.  Each
     part delimited by the comma consists of the language name, a colon,
     the shared object path, an optional colon followed by a function
     name.  If the function name is not specified, 'parser' is assumed.
     As a special exception, gtags collects values from multiple
     'gtags_parser' variables.
'icase_path' (boolean)
     Ignore case distinctions in the path.  Suffixes check is affected
     by this capability.
'langmap' (comma separated list)
     Language mapping.  Each comma-separated map consists of the
     language name, a colon, and a list of file extensions.  As a
     special exception, gtags collects values from multiple 'langmap'
     variables.  Default mapping is:
     'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.hh.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.
'skip' (comma separated list)
     Gtags skips files and directories which are given in this list.  As
     a special exception, gtags collects values from multiple 'skip'
     variables.  If the value ends with '/', it is assumed as a
     directory and gtags skips all files under it.  The value may
     include glob patterns (*, ?, [...], [!...], [^...]).  If the value
     starts with '/', it is assumed a relative path name from the root
     directory of the project.  You cannot use glob patterns for a path
     name.

   Addition to these, the variables listed in the ENVIRONMENT section
except for GTAGSCONF and GTAGSLABEL are also available as configuration
variables.  Each environment variable is given more priority than
configuration variable of the same name.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

Gtags exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

SEE ALSO

(http://www.gnu.org/software/global/).

BUG
---

'GTAGS' and 'GRTAGS' are very large.  In advance of using this command,
check the space of your disk.

   Assembly support is far from complete.  It extracts only 'ENTRY()'
and 'ALTENTRY()' from source file.  Probably valid only for FreeBSD and
Linux kernel source.

   There is no concurrency control about tag files.

5.3 htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files.
============================================================

NAME
----

htags - generate a hypertext from a set of source files.

SYNOPSIS
--------

     htags [-acDfFghInosTvwx][-d dbpath][-m name][-t title][dir]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Htags generates a hypertext from a set of source files of C, C++, Yacc,
Java, PHP and Assembly.

   In advance of using this command, you should execute gtags(1) in the
root directory of a source project.  Then you can execute htags in the
same place.  Htags makes a directory named 'HTML', and puts a hypertext
in it.  You can start browsing at 'HTML/index.html'.

   Since htags generates a static hypertext as long as the '-D' or '-f'
option is not specified, you can move it anywhere and browse it by any
browser without any HTTP server.

   This command has so many options.  If you are new to htags, it is
recommended to use the '--suggest' option.  With that option, htags
chooses popular options on your behalf.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:

'-a', '--alphabet'
     Make an alphabetical index suitable for a large project.
'--auto-completion'[=limit]
     Enable auto-completion facility for the input form.  If limit is
     specified, number of candidates is limited to the value.  Please
     note this function requires javascript language in your browser.
'--caution'
     Display a caution message on the top page.
'--cflow' cflowfile
     Add a call tree by cflow(1).  cflowfile must be posix format.  If
     you use GNU cflow, invoke the command at the project root directory
     with the '--format=posix' option.  This option is deprecated;
     please use '--call-tree' or '--callee-tree' instead.
'--call-tree' callfile
     Add a call tree by cflow(1); callfile must be posix format.  If you
     use GNU cflow, invoke the command at the project root directory
     with the '--format=posix' option.
'--callee-tree' calleefile
     Add a callee tree by cflow(1); calleefile must be posix format.  If
     you use GNU cflow, invoke the command at the project root directory
     with the '--format=posix' and '--reverse' options.
'-c', '--compact'
     Compress html files by gzip(1).  You need to configure HTTP server
     so that gzip(1) is invoked for each compressed file.  See
     'HTML/.htaccess' that is generated by htags.  This option is
     deprecated.
'--colorize-warned-line'
     Use color to highlight warned lines.
'--cvsweb' url
     Add a link to cvsweb; url is used as the base of URL. When
     directory 'CVS' exists in the root directory of the project, the
     content of 'CVS/Repository' is used as the relative path from the
     base.
'--cvsweb-cvsroot' cvsroot
     Specify cvsroot in cvsweb URL.
'-D', '--dynamic'
     Generate a tag list dynamically using CGI program.  Though this
     option decreases both the size and generation time of hypertext,
     you need to start up HTTP server.
'-d', '--dbpath' dbpath
     Specify the directory in which 'GTAGS' exists.  The default is the
     current directory.
'--disable-grep'
     Disable grep in the search form ('-f', '--form').
'--disable-idutils'
     Disable idutils in the search form ('-f', '--form').
'-F', '--frame'
     Use frames for the top page.
'-f', '--form'
     Add a search form using CGI program.  You need to start a HTTP
     server for it.
'--fixed-guide'
     Put a fixed guide at the bottom of the screen of the browser.
'--full-path'
     Use full path name in the file index.  By default, use just the
     last component of a path.
'-g', '--gtags'
     Execute gtags(1) before starting job.  The '-v', '-w' and dbpath
     options are passed to gtags.
'--gtagsconf' file
     Set environment variable GTAGSCONF to file.
'--gtagslabel' label
     Set environment variable GTAGSLABEL to label.
'-h', '--func-header'[=position]
     Insert a function header for each function.  By default, htags
     doesn't generate them.  You can choose the position using position,
     which allows one of 'before', 'right' or 'after' (default).
'--html-header' file
     Insert a header record derived from file into the HTML header of
     each file.
'-I', '--icon'
     Use icons instead of text for some links.
'--insert-footer' file
     Insert custom footer derived from file before '</body>' tag.
'--insert-header' file
     Insert custom header derived from file after '<body>' tag.
'--item-order' spec
     Specify the order of the items in the top page.  The spec is a
     string consisting of item signs in order.  Each sign means as
     follows: 'c': caution; 's': search form; 'm': mains; 'd':
     definitions; 'f': files; 't': call tree.  The default is 'csmdf'.
'-m', '--main-func' name
     Specify startup function name; the default is 'main'.
'--map-file'
     Generate file 'MAP'.
'-n', '--line-number'[=columns]
     Print line numbers.  By default, don't print line numbers.  The
     default value of columns is 4.

     Numbers are not given in list form.
'-o', '--other'
     Pick up not only source files but also other files for the file
     index.
'--overwrite-key'
     Allow overwrite of an existing key with the '--system-cgi' option.

     Use the system CGI script.  key must be a unique key in your site.
     At the first time, you should (1) copy the CGI script written by
     this command into the system CGI directory, and (2) execute
     'bless.sh' script at the 'HTML' directory as a root user.  This
     option is deprecated.
'-s', '--symbol'
     Make anchors not only for definitions and references but also other
     symbols.
'--show-position'

     be interpreted by general editors in UNIX. The default is false.
'--statistics'
     Print statistics information.
'--suggest'
     Htags chooses popular options on behalf of beginners.  It is
     equivalent to '-aghInosTxv --show-position --fixed-guide' now.
'--suggest2'
     Htags chooses popular options on behalf of beginners.  This option
     enables frame, AJAX and CGI facility in addition to the facilities
     by the '--suggest' option.  It is equivalent to '--suggest -DfF
     --auto-completion --tree-view=filetree' now.
'-T', '--table-flist'[=rows]
     Use '<table>' tag to display the file index.  You can optionally
     specify the number of rows; the default is 5.
'-t', '--title' title

     requires javascript language in your browser.  Possible values of
     type are as follows: treeview, filetree, treeview-red,
     treeview-black, treeview-gray, treeview-famfamfam.  The default is
     treeview.
'-v', '--verbose'
     Verbose mode.
'-w', '--warning'
     Print warning messages.
'-x', '--xhtml'[=version]
     Generate XHTML hypertext.  This is the default.  If the '--frame'
     option is specified then generate XHTML-1.0 Frameset for
     'index.html' and XHTML-1.0 Transitional for other files; else if
     version is '1.1' or config variable 'xhtml_version' is set to '1.1'
     then generate XHTML-1.1; else generate XHTML-1.0 Transitional.
     This option is deprecated.
dir
     The directory in which the result of this command is stored.  The
     default is the current directory.

5.4 htags-server - start a private Web/CGI server for hyper-text
================================================================

NAME
----

htags-server - start a private Web/CGI server for hyper-text

SYNOPSIS
--------

     htags-server [-b ip-address][-u language][port]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Htags-server is a private Web/CGI server for the hyper-text generated by
htags(1).

   In advance of using this command, you should execute htags(1).  Then
you can execute htags-server at the same place.  You can start browsing
at 'http://localhost:8000/' by default.  To stop the server, just press
on 'CTRL-C'.

   Python 2/3 or Ruby equipped with WEBrick is required.  By default,
htags-server looks for python first, if not found then looks for ruby.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
'-b', '--bind' ip-address
     Specifies the IP address on which htags-server listen.  The default
     value is 127.0.0.1.
'-u', '--use' language
     Specifies language to use, which may be one of: 'python' and
     'ruby'.
port
     Specifies the port on which htags-server listen.  If you want to
     use multiple sessions, you must use unique number for each
     htags-server.  The default value is 8000.

EXAMPLES
--------

     	$ gtags
     	$ htags --suggest2
     	$ htags-server
     	Python2 http/cgi server
     	Serving HTTP on 127.0.0.1 port 8000 ...

     	(another terminal)
     	$ firefox http://localhost:8000/

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

Htags-server exits with a non-0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.

SEE ALSO
--------

NAME
----

gozilla - force mozilla to display specified part of a source file.

SYNOPSIS
--------

     gozilla [-b browser][-p][+no] file
     gozilla [-b browser][-p] -d name

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Gozilla forces mozilla to display specified part of a source file.
Gozilla can be used with other browsers like firefox and epiphany.

   In advance of using this command, you must execute gtags(1) and
htags(1) at the root directory of the project to make tag files.  Then
you can execute this command anywhere in the project.

   First form:
You can specify a source file and optional line number.  This syntax is
similar to vi(1) and emacs(1).

   Second form:
You can specify a definition name directly.  The definition name should
exist in 'GTAGS'.  This option requires 'HTML/MAP' generated by
htags(1).

   Some browsers require you to load it before executing gozilla.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:
'+no'
     Line number.
'-b' browser
     Browser to use.  By default, it is assumed mozilla.
'-d' name
     Print definitions.
'--help'
     Show help.
'-p'
     Just print a generated URL instead of displaying it.
file
     File name or alias name.
'-q', '--quiet'
     Quiet mode.
'-v', '--verbose'
     Verbose mode.
'--version'

5.6 gtags-cscope - interactively examine a C program.
=====================================================

NAME
----

gtags-cscope - interactively examine a C program.

SYNOPSIS
--------

     gtags-cscope [-bCdehLlVv][-F file ][-012345678 pattern][-p n]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

gtags-cscope is an interactive, screen-oriented tool that allows the
user to browse through C source files for specified elements of code.

   gtags-cscope builds the symbol cross-reference the first time it is
used on the source files for the program being browsed.  On a subsequent
invocation, gtags-cscope rebuilds the cross-reference only if a source
file has changed or the list of source files is different.  When the
cross-reference is rebuilt, it is updated incrementally, which makes
rebuilding faster than the initial build.

OPTIONS
-------

Some command line arguments can only occur as the only argument in the
execution of gtags-cscope.  They cause the program to just print out
some output and exit immediately:

'-h'
     View the long usage help display.
'-V'
     Print the version number of gtags-cscope.
'--help'
     Same as '-h'
'--version'
     Same as '-V'

   The following options can appear in any combination:

'-a'
     Print absolute path names.
'-b'
     Build the cross-reference only.
'-C'
     Ignore letter case when searching.
'-d'
     Do not update the cross-reference.
'-e'
     Suppress the '^e' command prompt between files.
'-F' file
     Read symbol reference lines from file.  (A symbol reference file is
     created by > and >>, and can also be read using the < command,
     described under "Issuing Subsequent Requests", below.)
'-i'
     Ignore SIGINT signal in line-oriented mode.
'-L'
     Do a single search with line-oriented output when used with the
     -num pattern option.
'-l'
     Line-oriented interface.  This option implies the '-d' option.
'-[0-9]' pattern
     Go to input field num (counting from 0) and find pattern.
'-p' n
     Display the last n file path components instead of the default (1).
     Use '0' to not display the file name at all.
'-v'
     Be more verbose in line-oriented mode.

Requesting the initial search
-----------------------------

After the cross-reference is ready, gtags-cscope will display this menu:

     	Find this C symbol:
     	Find this function definition:
     	Find functions called by this function (N/A):
     	Find functions calling this function:
     	Find this text string:
     	Change this text string:
     	Find this egrep pattern:
     	Find this file:
     	Find files #including this file:

   Press the <Up> or <Down> keys repeatedly to move to the desired input
field, type the text to search for, and then press the <Return> key.

Issuing subsequent requests
---------------------------

If the search is successful, any of these single-character commands can
be used:

0-9a-zA-Z
     Edit the file referenced by the given line number.
<Space>
     Display next set of matching lines.
<Tab>
     Alternate between the menu and the list of matching lines
<Up>
     Move to the previous menu item (if the cursor is in the menu) or
     move to the previous matching line (if the cursor is in the
     matching line list).
<Down>
     Move to the next menu item (if the cursor is in the menu) or move
     to the next matching line (if the cursor is in the matching line
     list).
+
     Display next set of matching lines.
-
     Display previous set of matching lines.
^e
     Edit displayed files in order.
>
     Write the displayed list of lines to a file.
>>
     Append the displayed list of lines to a file.
<
     Read lines from a file that is in symbol reference format (created
     by '>' or '>>'), just like the '-F' option.
^
     Filter all lines through a shell command and display the resulting
     lines, replacing the lines that were already there.
|
     Pipe all lines to a shell command and display them without changing
     them.
^g
     Read lines from the result of the execution of global(1).

   At any time these single-character commands can also be used:
<Return>
     Move to next input field.
^n
     Move to next input field.
^p
     Move to previous input field.
^y
     Search with the last text typed.
^b
     Move to previous input field and search pattern.
^f
     Move to next input field and search pattern.
^c
     Toggle ignore/use letter case when searching.  (When ignoring
     letter case, a search for 'FILE' will match 'File' and 'file'.)
^r
     Rebuild the cross-reference.
!
     Start an interactive shell (type '^d' to return to gtags-cscope).
^l
     Redraw the screen.
?
     Give help information about gtags-cscope commands.
^d
     Exit gtags-cscope.

   NOTE: If the first character of the text to be searched for matches
one of the above commands, escape it by typing a '\' (backslash) first.

   Substituting new text for old text

   After the text to be changed has been typed, gtags-cscope will prompt
for the new text, and then it will display the lines containing the old
text.  Select the lines to be changed with these single-character
commands:
0-9a-zA-Z
     Mark or unmark the line to be changed.
*
     Mark or unmark all displayed lines to be changed.
<Space>
     Display next set of lines.
+
     Display next set of lines.
-
     Display previous set of lines.
^a
     Mark or unmark all lines to be changed.
^d
     Change the marked lines and exit.
<Esc>
     Exit without changing the marked lines.
!
     Start an interactive shell (type '^d' to return to gtags-cscope).
^l
     Redraw the screen.
?
     Give help information about gtags-cscope commands.
Special keys
     If your terminal has arrow keys that work in vi, you can use them
     to move around the input fields.  The up-arrow key is useful to
     move to the previous input field instead of using the <Tab> key
     repeatedly.  If you have <CLEAR>, <NEXT>, or <PREV> keys they will
     act as the '^l', '+', and '-' commands, respectively.

Line-Oriented interface
-----------------------

The '-l' option lets you use gtags-cscope where a screen-oriented
interface would not be useful, for example, from another screen-oriented
program.

   gtags-cscope will prompt with '>>' when it is ready for an input
line, which starts with the field number (counting from 0), immediately
followed by the search pattern.  For example, '1main' finds the
definition of the 'main' function.

   If you just want a single search, instead of the '-l' option use the
'-L' and '-num pattern' options, and you won't get the '>>' prompt.

   For '-l', gtags-cscope outputs the number of reference lines:
cscope: 2 lines

   For each reference found, gtags-cscope outputs a line consisting of
the file name, function name, line number, and line text, separated by
spaces.  For example:
main.c main 161 main(argc, argv)

   Note that the editor is not called to display a single reference,
unlike the screen-oriented interface.

   You can use the 'c' command to toggle ignore/use letter case when
searching.  (When ignoring letter case, a search for 'FILE' will match
'File' and 'file'.)

   You can use the 'r' command to rebuild the database.

   gtags-cscope will quit when it detects end-of-file, or when the first
character of an input line is '^d' or 'q'.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

The following environment variables are of cscope origin.

CSCOPE_EDITOR
     Overrides the EDITOR and VIEWER variables.  Use this if you wish to
     use a different editor with cscope than that specified by your
     EDITOR/VIEWER variables.
CSCOPE_LINEFLAG
     Format of the line number flag for your editor.  By default, cscope
     invokes your editor via the equivalent of 'editor +N file', where N
     is the line number that the editor should jump to.  This format is
     used by both emacs and vi.  If your editor needs something
     different, specify it in this variable, with '%s' as a placeholder
     for the line number.  Eg: if your editor needs to be invoked as
     'editor -#103 file' to go to line 103, set this variable to '-#%s'.
CSCOPE_LINEFLAG_AFTER_FILE
     Set this variable to 'yes' if your editor needs to be invoked with
     the line number option after the filename to be edited.  To
     continue the example from CSCOPE_LINEFLAG, above: if your editor
     needs to see 'editor file -#number', set this environment variable.
     Users of most standard editors (vi, emacs) do not need to set this
     variable.
EDITOR
     Preferred editor, which defaults to vi.
HOME
     Home directory, which is automatically set at login.
SHELL
     Preferred shell, which defaults to sh.
TERM
     Terminal type, which must be a screen terminal.
TERMINFO
     Terminal information directory full path name.  If your terminal is
     not in the standard terminfo directory, see curses and terminfo for
     how to make your own terminal description.
TMPDIR
     Temporary file directory, which defaults to '/tmp'.
VIEWER
     Preferred file display program (such as less), which overrides
     EDITOR (see above).

   The following environment variables are of GLOBAL origin.

GTAGSCONF
     Configuration file.  The default is '$HOME/.globalrc'.
GTAGSGLOBAL
     If this variable is set, '$GTAGSGLOBAL' is used as the name of
     global(1).  The default is global.
GTAGSGTAGS
     If this variable is set, '$GTAGSGTAGS' is used as the name of
     gtags(1).  The default is gtags.
GTAGSDBPATH
     The directory in which the tag files exist.  This value is ignored
     when GTAGSROOT is not defined.
GTAGSLABEL
     Configuration label.  The default is 'default'.
GTAGSLIBPATH
     If this variable is set, it is used as the path to search for
     library functions.  If the specified tags is not found in the
     project, global also searches in these paths.  Since only 'GTAGS'
     is targeted in the retrieval, this variable is ignored when '-r' or
     '-s' is specified.
GTAGSROOT
     The root directory of the project.
MAKEOBJDIR
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIR' is used as the name of
     BSD-style objdir.  The default is 'obj'.
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX
     If this variable is set, '$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX' is used as the prefix
     of BSD-style objdir.  The default is '/usr/obj'.

FILES
-----

'GTAGS'
     Tag file for definitions.
'GRTAGS'
     Tag file for references.
'GPATH'
     Tag file for source files.
'GTAGSROOT'
     If environment variable GTAGSROOT is not set and file 'GTAGSROOT'
     exists in the same directory as 'GTAGS' then global sets GTAGSROOT
     to the contents of the file.
'$HOME/.globalrc', '/etc/gtags.conf', '[sysconfdir]/gtags.conf'
     Configuration files.

Cscope was originally developed at Bell Labs in the early 1980s, and was
released as free software under the BSD license in April 2000.
Gtags-cscope is a derivative of cscope to use GLOBAL as the back-end.
Its line-oriented interface was originally written in 2006, and was
re-implemented in 2011 using cscope itself.

A.1 GNU Free Documentation License
==================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
