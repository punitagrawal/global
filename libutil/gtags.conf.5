.TH GTAGS.CONF 5 "Nov 2015" "GNU Project"
.SH NAME
gtags.conf \- configuration data for GNU GLOBAL
.SH SYNOPSIS
\'gtags.conf\'
.br
\'~/.globalrc\'
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\'gtags.conf\' has configuration data for \fBglobal\fP(1), \fBgozilla\fP(1),
\fBgtags\fP(1) and \fBhtags\fP(1). They look for the following files in this order,
and read from the first one that exists and is readable.
.TP
(1) --gtagsconf \fIfile\fP
.TP
(2) $GTAGSCONF
.TP
(3) [project root]/gtags.conf
.TP
(4) [project root]/[objdir]/gtags.conf
.TP
(5) $HOME/.globalrc
.TP
(6) /etc/gtags.conf
.TP
(7) [sysconfdir]/gtags.conf
.PP
[sysconfdir] is \'/usr/local/etc\' by default; you can change it by the --sysconfdir
option of the configure script. [objdir] is \'obj\' by default; you can change it
by \fBGTAGSOBJDIR\fP or \fBMAKEOBJDIR\fP.
.PP
Syntax is similar to \fBtermcap\fP(5) except for some extensions described later.
A file includes one or more records. You should select a record using a label.
Default label is \'default\'. If \fBGTAGSLABEL\fP is set, its value is used.
Please be aware the meaning of \'default\' is different from that of \fBtermcap\fP(5).
.PP
Lines starting with \'#\' are ignored.
A record consists of one or more fields separated by \':\' and ends with a newline.
The first field must have a label name. Each field of the rest has a variable definition.
There are three types in those variables.
.TP
Boolean: This type has no value; existence of variable means true else false.
.TP
Number: This type has a number value after \'#\'.
.TP
String: This type has a string value after \'=\'.
Most variables are relevant to string type.
.PP
If data includes \':\' or newline, you need to quote it by \'\\'.
An empty field is permitted, but it doesn't make sense.
.PP
When there is more than one definition, the previous one is adopted. 
Exceptionally, all values of \fBskip\fP, \fBlangmap\fP and \fBgtags_parser\fP are
adopted and connected respectively.
.SH "Variable substitution"
Variable substitution similar to \fBsh\fP(1) is available.
You can refer to any string variable using \'$\' prefix. For example, the following
\fBb\fP has a value \'XYZ\'.
.nf
:a=Y:b=X${a}Z:
.fi
.SH "Including another record"
\fBTc\fP is a special variable; it reads in definitions in another record.
It is similar to the \fBtc\fP of \fBtermcap\fP(5).
Syntax is as follows:
.br
\fBtc\fP=\fIlabel\fP[@\fIfile\fP]
.br
If only a \fIlabel\fP is given, \fBtc\fP is read from a record specified by the \fIlabel\fP
in the same file. If @\fIfile\fP is also given, \fBtc\fP is read from a record
specified by the \fIlabel\fP in the specified \fIfile\fP.
\fIFile\fP should be an absolute path, and should not include variables.
Different from \fBtermcap\fP(5), you can use \fBtc\fP anytime anywhere.
.SH CONFIGURATION
About variables for each command, please see each manual.
.PP
You can use the following environment variables as a string variable.
If these variables are set then environment variables of the same name are set before
command execution.
.br
\fBGREP_COLOR\fP
.br
\fBGREP_COLORS\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSBLANKENCODE\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSCACHE\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSFORCECPP\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSGLOBAL\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSGTAGS\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSLIBPATH\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSLOGGING\fP
.br
\fBGTAGSTHROUGH\fP
.br
\fBGTAGS_OPTIONS\fP
.br
\fBHTAGS_OPTIONS\fP
.br
\fBMAKEOBJDIR\fP
.br
\fBMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\fP
.br
\fBTMPDIR\fP
.br
.PP
The following variables are also available as a string variable.
By default, each of them has a directory path given by the configure
script.
.br
\fBbindir\fP
.br
\fBdatadir\fP
.br
\fBlibdir\fP
.br
\fBlocalstatedir\fP
.br
\fBsysconfdir\fP
.br
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of the commands.
.PP
.TP
\fBGTAGSCONF\fP
If this variable is set, the value is used as a configuration file.
.TP
\fBGTAGSLABEL\fP
If this variable is set, the value is used as a label of the configuration file.
The default is \fIdefault\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
