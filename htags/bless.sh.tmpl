# Usage:
#       $ sh bless.sh
#
# This script is generated by htags when the the --system-cgi option is
# specified; It is essentially one line script.
#
# (1) generating a hypertext
#
# System CGI script for htags refers a database directory:
#
#	/usr/local/var/gtags/sitekeys
#
# It is not writable for general users by default. This script offers a method
# to separate the privilege to update the database from general users.
#
#	$ htags -f --system-cgi=mykey
#	$ cd HTML
#	# sh bless.sh			# update the database
#
# If you don't want to use this script, please change the directory to writable.
# If it is writable, htags updates it directly. So, this script is not needed.
#
# (2) moving the hypertext
#
# After moving the hypertext, you should execute this script again.
#
#	$ mv HTML /home/tmp
#	$ cd /home/tmp/HTML
#	$ sh bless.sh
#
if [ ! -f 'bless.sh' ]; then
	echo "Bless.sh script should be executed as 'sh bless.sh'."
	exit 1
fi
#
# Bless the site key.
