@HEADER	GTAGS-PARSER,1,March 2008,GNU Project
@NAME	gtags-parser - print cross reference list for gtags.
@SYNOPSIS
	@name{gtags-parser} [-bdenqrstvw] @arg{file} ...
@DESCRIPTION
	@name{Gtags-parser} print cross reference list for @xref{gtags,1}
	from the specified C, C++, yacc, java, PHP and Assembly source
	to standard output.
	Each line of output contains the object name,
	the line number which it appears, the file in which it is defined,
	and a line image separated by white-space.
	It's same with the output of @xref{ctags,1} with @option{-x} option.

	Depending upon the options provided to @name{gtags-parser},
	objects will consist of object definitions, object references
	and other symbols.

	Files whose names end in @file{.c} or @file{.h} are assumed to be C
	source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.c++} @file{.cc} @file{.cpp}
	@file{.cxx} @file{.hxx} @file{.hpp} @file{.C} @file{.H} are assumed to be C++
	source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.y} are assumed to be YACC source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.java} are assumed to be Java source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.php} @file{.php3} @file{.phtml} are
	assumed to be PHP source files.
	Files whose names end in @file{.s} or @file{.S} are assumed to be
	Assembly source files.
	Other files are searched for C style definitions.

	Yacc files each have a special tag. @name{yyparse} is the start
	of the second section of the yacc file.

	This command is the default parser of GLOBAL source code tag system.
@OPTIONS
	The following options are available:
	@begin_itemize
	@item{@option{-b}, @option{--begin-block}}
		Force level 1 block to begin when reach the left brace at the first column.
		(C only)
	@item{@option{-e}, @option{--end-block}}
		Force level 1 block to end when reach the right brace at the first column.
		(C only)
	@item{@option{-n}, @option{--no-tags}}
		Suppress output of tags. It is useful to use with @option{-w} option.
	@item{@option{-q}, @option{--quiet}}
		Quiet mode.
	@item{@option{-r}, @option{--reference}}
		Locate object references instead of object definitions.
		@file{GTAGS} is needed at the current directory.
		(C, C++ and Java source only)
		By default, locate object definitions.
	@item{@option{-s}, @option{--symbol}}
		Collect symbols other than object definitions and references.
		By default, locate object definitions.
	@item{@option{-v}, @option{--verbose}}
		Verbose mode.
	@item{@option{-w}, @option{--warning}}
		Print warning message.
	@item{@option{--langmap}=map}
		Language mapping. Each comma-separated  map  consists of
		the language name, a colon, and a list of file extensions.
		Default mapping is 'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.
	@end_itemize

	The @option{-r} and @option{-s} options override each other;
	the last one specified determines the method used.
@ENVIRONMENT
	The following environment variables affect the execution of @name{gtags-parser}:
        @begin_itemize
        @item{@var{GTAGSFORCECPP}}
                If this variable is set, each file whose suffix is 'h' is treated
                as a C++ source file.
	@end_itemize
@DIAGNOSTICS
	@name{Gtags-parser} exits with a non 0 value if an error occurred, 0 otherwise.
	Duplicate objects are not considered errors.
