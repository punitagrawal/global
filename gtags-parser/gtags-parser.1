gtags\-parser - print cross reference list for gtags.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgtags-parser\fP [-bdenqrstvw] \fIfile\fP ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGtags-parser\fP print cross reference list for \fBgtags\fP(1)
from the specified C, C++, yacc, java, PHP and Assembly source
to standard output.
Each line of output contains the object name,
the line number which it appears, the file in which it is defined,
and a line image separated by white-space.
It's same with the output of \fBctags\fP(1) with \fB-x\fP option.
.PP
Depending upon the options provided to \fBgtags-parser\fP,
objects will consist of object definitions, object references
and other symbols.
.PP
Files whose names end in \'.c\' or \'.h\' are assumed to be C
source files.
Files whose names end in \'.c++\' \'.cc\' \'.cpp\'
\'.cxx\' \'.hxx\' \'.hpp\' \'.C\' \'.H\' are assumed to be C++
source files.
Files whose names end in \'.y\' are assumed to be YACC source files.
Files whose names end in \'.java\' are assumed to be Java source files.
Files whose names end in \'.php\' \'.php3\' \'.phtml\' are
assumed to be PHP source files.
Files whose names end in \'.s\' or \'.S\' are assumed to be
Assembly source files.
Other files are searched for C style definitions.
.PP
Yacc files each have a special tag. \fByyparse\fP is the start
of the second section of the yacc file.
.PP
This command is the default parser of GLOBAL source code tag system.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-q\fP, \fB--quiet\fP

.TP
\fB-r\fP, \fB--reference\fP

Default mapping is 'c:.c.h,yacc:.y,asm:.s.S,java:.java,cpp:.c++.cc.cpp.cxx.hxx.hpp.C.H,php:.php.php3.phtml'.
.PP
The \fB-r\fP and \fB-s\fP options override each other;
the last one specified determines the method used.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of \fBgtags-parser\fP:
