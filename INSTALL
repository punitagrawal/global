Installation of GNU GLOBAL.

[Note]  Though GNU GLOBAL supports only UNIX(POSIX) environment,
        some outside projects develop DOS or Windows 32 version of it.
        Please see:
                http://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html

o If you want to use the -I option of global(1) then idutils(1) is needed.

   You can get idutils at:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/idutils/
  
o If you want to use the --form(-f) or --dynamic(-D) option of htags(1) then
  Perl version 5 or later is needed.

   If you don't have it, you can fetch it from this site.

	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/

2. How to install.

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

	(You can see the options of configure by invoking './configure --help')
