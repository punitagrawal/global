.SH NAME
gtags\-cscope - interactively examine a C program.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgtags-cscope\fP [-bCdehLlVv][-F file ][-012345678 \fIpattern\fP][-p n]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgtags-cscope\fP is an interactive, screen-oriented tool that allows the user to
browse through C source files for specified elements of code.
.PP
\fBgtags-cscope\fP builds the symbol cross-reference the first time it is used on
the source files for the program being browsed. On a subsequent invocation, 
\fBgtags-cscope\fP rebuilds the cross-reference only if a source file
has changed or the list of source files is different. When the
cross-reference is rebuilt, it is updated incrementally, which makes rebuilding faster
than the initial build.
.SH OPTIONS
Some command line arguments can only occur as the only argument in
the execution of \fBgtags-cscope\fP.  They cause the program to just print out
some output and exit immediately:
.PP
.TP
\fB-h\fP
View the long usage help display.
.TP
\fB-V\fP
Print the version number of \fBgtags-cscope\fP.
.TP
\fB--help\fP

or move to the previous matching line (if the cursor is in the
matching line list).
.TP
<Down>
Move to the next menu item (if the cursor is in the menu)
or move to the next matching line (if the cursor is in the
matching line list).

.TP
?
Give help information about \fBgtags-cscope\fP commands.
.TP
Special keys
If your terminal has arrow keys that work in \fBvi\fP, you can use them
to move around the input fields. The up-arrow key is useful to move to
the previous
input field instead of using the <Tab> key repeatedly. If you have
<CLEAR>, <NEXT>, or <PREV> keys they will act as the \'^l\', \'+\',
and \'-\' commands, respectively.
.SH "Line-Oriented interface"
The \fB-l\fP option lets you use \fBgtags-cscope\fP
where a screen-oriented interface
would not be useful, for example, from another screen-oriented program.
.PP
\fBgtags-cscope\fP will prompt with \'>>\' when it is ready
for an input line, which starts
with the field number (counting from 0), immediately followed by the
search pattern. For example, \'1main\' finds the definition of the
\'main\' function.
.PP
If you just want a single search, instead of the \fB-l\fP option use
the \fB-L\fP and \fB-num \fIpattern\fP\fP options,
and you won't get the \'>>\' prompt.
.PP
For \fB-l\fP, \fBgtags-cscope\fP outputs the number of reference lines:
.br
cscope: 2 lines
.PP
For each reference found, \fBgtags-cscope\fP outputs a line consisting of the file
name, function name, line number, and line text, separated by spaces.
For example:
.br
main.c main 161 main(argc, argv)
.PP
Note that the editor is not called to display a single reference,
unlike the screen-oriented interface.
.PP
You can use the \'c\' command to toggle ignore/use letter case when
searching. (When ignoring letter case, a search for \'FILE\' will
match \'File\' and \'file\'.)
.PP
You can use the \'r\' command to rebuild the database.
.PP
\fBgtags-cscope\fP will quit when it detects end-of-file, or when the first
character of an input line is \'^d\' or \'q\'.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables are of \fBcscope\fP origin.
.PP
.TP
\fBCSCOPE_EDITOR\fP
Overrides the \fBEDITOR\fP and \fBVIEWER\fP variables.
Use this if you wish to use a different editor with \fBcscope\fP
than that specified by your \fBEDITOR\fP/\fBVIEWER\fP variables.
.TP
\fBCSCOPE_LINEFLAG\fP
Format of the line number flag for your editor.
By default, \fBcscope\fP invokes your editor via the equivalent of
\'editor +\fIN\fP \fIfile\fP\', where \fIN\fP is the line number
that the editor should jump to.
This format is used by both \fBemacs\fP and \fBvi\fP.
If your editor needs something different, specify it in this variable,
with \'%s\' as a placeholder for the line number.
Eg: if your editor needs to be invoked as \'editor -#103 \fIfile\fP\'
to go to line 103, set this variable to \'-#%s\'.
.TP
\fBCSCOPE_LINEFLAG_AFTER_FILE\fP
Set this variable to \'yes\' if your editor needs to be invoked with
the line number option after the filename to be edited. To continue
the example from \fBCSCOPE_LINEFLAG\fP, above: if your editor needs to see
\'editor \fIfile\fP -#\fInumber\fP\', set this environment variable.
Users of most standard editors (\fBvi\fP, \fBemacs\fP) do not need
to set this variable.
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fP
Preferred editor, which defaults to \fBvi\fP.
.TP
\fBHOME\fP
Home directory, which is automatically set at login.
.TP
\fBSHELL\fP
Preferred shell, which defaults to \fBsh\fP.
.TP
\fBTERM\fP
Terminal type, which must be a screen terminal.
.TP
\fBTERMINFO\fP
Terminal information directory full path name. If your terminal
is not in the standard terminfo directory, see \fBcurses\fP
and \fBterminfo\fP for how to make your own terminal description.
.TP
\fBTMPDIR\fP
Temporary file directory, which defaults to \'/tmp\'.
.TP
\fBVIEWER\fP
Preferred file display program (such as \fBless\fP), which overrides
\fBEDITOR\fP (see above).
.PP
The following environment variables are of \fBGLOBAL\fP origin.
.PP
.TP
\fBGTAGSCONF\fP
Configuration file. The default is \'$HOME/.globalrc\'.
.TP
\fBGTAGSGLOBAL\fP
If this variable is set, \'$GTAGSGLOBAL\' is used as the name
of \fBglobal\fP(1). The default is \fBglobal\fP.
.TP
\fBGTAGSGTAGS\fP
If this variable is set, \'$GTAGSGTAGS\' is used as the name
of \fBgtags\fP(1). The default is \fBgtags\fP.
.TP
\fBGTAGSDBPATH\fP
The directory in which the tag files exist.
This value is ignored when \fBGTAGSROOT\fP is not defined.
.TP
\fBGTAGSLABEL\fP
Configuration label. The default is \'default\'.
.TP
\fBGTAGSLIBPATH\fP
If this variable is set, it is used as the path to search
for library functions. If the specified tags is not
found in the project, \fBglobal\fP also searches in these paths.
Since only \'GTAGS\' is targeted in the retrieval, this variable is
ignored when \fB-r\fP or \fB-s\fP is specified.
.TP
\fBGTAGSROOT\fP
The root directory of the project.
.TP
\fBMAKEOBJDIR\fP
If this variable is set, \'$MAKEOBJDIR\' is used as the name
of BSD-style objdir. The default is \'obj\'.
.TP
\fBMAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\fP
If this variable is set, \'$MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX\' is used as the prefix
of BSD-style objdir. The default is \'/usr/obj\'.
.SH FILES
.TP
\'GTAGS\'
Tag file for definitions.
.TP
\'GRTAGS\'
Tag file for references.
.TP
\'GPATH\'
Tag file for source files.
.TP
\'GTAGSROOT\'
If environment variable \fBGTAGSROOT\fP is not set
and file \'GTAGSROOT\' exists in the same directory as \'GTAGS\'
then \fBglobal\fP sets \fBGTAGSROOT\fP to the contents of the file.
.TP
\'$HOME/.globalrc\', \'/etc/gtags.conf\', \'[sysconfdir]/gtags.conf\'
Configuration files.

.SH HISTORY
\fBCscope\fP was originally developed at Bell Labs in the early 1980s,
and was released as free software under the BSD license in April 2000.
\fBGtags-cscope\fP is a derivative of \fBcscope\fP to use \fBGLOBAL\fP
as the back-end.
Its line-oriented interface was originally written in 2006, and was
re-implemented in 2011 using \fBcscope\fP itself.
