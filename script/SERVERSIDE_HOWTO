Usage of server-side GLOBAL

If the following conditions are met, you can use server-side GLOBAL facilities
without installing GLOBAL in your client machine.

1. You have a server machine in which GLOBAL is installed. 
   (called the "server" below)
2. You can log in the server without pass word using ssh from your machine.
   (called the "client" below)
3. You can access the same project of the both sides (client and server)
   by the same path name probably using Network File System(NFS).

How to use server-site GLOBAL.

1. Make some shell scripts (global-client, gtags-client, htags-client) available
   by copying or network mounting. These are in /usr/local/share/gtags/scripts
   on the server.
2. Set the server name to 'GTAGSREMOTEHOST' environment variable. If your
   user id on the server is different from the one on the client, set the user id
   to 'GTAGSREMOTEUSER'.  And you can use above scripts instead of global, gtags
   and htags respectively.

3. To use the various environments which GLOBAL supports, please set the
   following variables like follows:
	GTAGSGTAGS=gtags-client
	GTAGSGLOBAL=global-client
	LESSGLOBALTAGS=less-global	(if you use less)

	[$HOME/.elvisrc]		(if you use elvis)
	+----------------------------
	|set tagprg="elvis-global $1"

Good luck!
