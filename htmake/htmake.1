.SH NAME
htmake \- create GLOBAL hypertext source searchable by gsearch.cgi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR htmake " [" "htags options" "] [" --url=base-url ]
.RI [ destdir ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B htmake
is a wrapper script that creates searchable hypertext from program 
source code and records information into a \fBpath database\fP
needed for a centralised search mechanism.
.PP
Prior to using this command you must have installed gsearch.cgi
using the \fBhtconfig -I\fP option and configured the location
of the \fBpath database\fP in \fIhtmake.conf\fP
.PP
Before you can create the hypertext source you need to execute
\fBgtags\fP(1) from the root directory of the source tree.
\fBhtmake\fP is then called from the same place.
.PP
\fBhtmake\fP uses \fBhtags\fP(1) to create the hypertext with a
unique id and \fBhtconfig\fP(1) to make the required entries in
the \fBpath database\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options will be passed to \fBhtags\fP(1) if used.
.TP
.B -a
Make an alphabetical function index.
.TP
.B -c
Compress html. Use gzip(1) with .ghtml suffix.
.TP
.B -C
Compress html. Use gzip(1) with .html.gz suffix.
.TP
.B -d \fItagdir\fP, --tags=gtagsdbpath
Specifies the directory in which GTAGS and GRTAGS exist. The default is the current directory.

.B --action=cgi-url

.I http://localhost/cgi-bin/gsearch.cgi
.PP
The remaining options are more general or are passed to \fBhtconfig\fP(1).
.TP
.B --url=base-url
the base url for your new hypertext source.
For best results always use absolute url's here.
