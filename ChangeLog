ChangeLog about GNU GLOBAL

December 18 2013, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	The following paths were removed from the candidate list of configuration file.

	/etc/global.conf (OLD_GTAGSCONF)
	/etc/gtags/global.conf (OLD_DEBIANCONF)

	These paths were not documented once.

November 17 2013, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Added two functions: copyfile(), copydirectory(). They remove the necessity
	of external command 'cp'.

June 17 2013, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Dependence to dbop.c module was eliminated from assoc.c module.

June 12 2013, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	File 'HTML/sitekey' (--system-cgi option) was removed since it is unnecessary.

December 11 2012, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Some automake macros were changed as follows to avoid warning messages.
	o INCLUDES was changed to AM_CPPFLAGS
	o AC_PROG_RANLIB was removed.

December 3 2012, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	[global/literal.c]
	Included fgrep's code of 4.3BSD.

October 20 2012, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Added support for type string of ctags.
	Configure script detects whether ctags has --gtags option or not.
	However, I don't know whether the ctags which has this option will be released.

	Exuberant Ctags with --gtags option:
	$ ctags --gtags -x ...
	D main              320 global/global.c  main(int argc, char **argv)
	R NULL              325 global/global.c  const char *av = NULL;
	=
	^-- Type string (D: definition, R: other than definition)

October 13 2012, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Comments were rewritten in the Doxygen style. Submitted by Simon Dommett.
	To generate a document, please invoke make command in the root directory
	of the project like follows:

	$ make doxygen

	doxygen 1.8.2 is required.

June 9 2012, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Added BUILD_TOOLS file, which includes the list of version numbers
	of the building tools used for building GLOBAL. It is automatically
	generated by reconf.sh.

March 15 2011, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Included cscope's source code.

	[Added source files]		[cscope-15.7]
	m4/check_curses.m4		configure.in

February 4 2011, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Configure.ac was modified to detect POSIX sort program automatically.

August 30 2010, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Renamed the style sheet file in the source package from style.css to
	style.css.tmpl, because to follow the custom of naming of other templates.

August 12 2010, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Modification of the -S option.

	o Renamed from '-S(--secure-cgi)' to '--system-cgi' because the
	  parameter is changed.
	o Changed the site key directory from 'datadir' to 'localstatedir'
	  because 'datadir' is for read-only data.
	o Changed the permission of the site key directory from 773 to 775.

	These most was suggested by Ron Lee.

June 27 2010, Shigo YAMAGUCHI

	Modification of the -S option.

	1. New htags requires a unique key as the parameter of the -S option.
	   (It is a incompatible change.)
	2. Htags makes a file whose name is the key in shared area, and
	   put the path of the HTML directory in it.
	3. To make the file name unique, a key that already exists
	   is not allowed without --over-write option.

	[in /var/src]
	$ htags ... -S key1
		       ====
			 |
			 +----------------+-----+
					  v     |               
	[/usr/local/share/gtags/sitekeys/key1]  |
	+--------------------------------       |
	|/var/src/HTML                          |     ... (2)
						|
	[/var/src/HTML/index.html]              |
	+--------------------------------       |
	|...                                    v
	|<input type='hidden' name='id' value='key1'> ... (1)
					       ====

	The center CGI script can know the path of the HTML directory by the following
	method.

	(1) get a unique key from the variable 'id'
		=> 'key1'
	(2) read directory name from '/usr/local/share/gtags/sitekeys/' + 'key1'
		=> '/var/src/HTML'

	This mechanism conceals the real path name of the HTML directory.

May 21 2010, Shigo YAMAGUCHI

	* Removed support for command layer plug-in parser(gtags-parser/).

May 20 2010, Shigo YAMAGUCHI

	* Changed the architecture of gtags(1) from 2 pass to 1 pass.

	[Current]

        Pass 1:                      +-------+ 
          source files =============>| gtags |============> GTAGS
                                     |       |============> GPATH
                                     |       |============> temporary file
                                     +-------+
        Pass 2:                      +-------+
         temporary file ============>| gtags |============> GRTAGS
                  GTAGS ============>|       |============> GSYMS
                                     +-------+
	[New]

        Pass 1:                      +-------+
          source files =============>| gtags |============> GPATH
                                     |       |==>[sort]===> GTAGS
                                     |       |==>[sort]===> GRTAGS
                                     +-------+
	(1) 1 pass architecture
		GLOBAL doesn't use GSYMS any longer. Symbols stored there before are
		put into GRTAGS instead. The divergence to GRTAGS and GSYMS is done
		in referring stage (gtags_first() and gtags_next()) not in generating
		stage. This change removes complexity from the program very much.
	 
	(2) Sorted writing
		The (1) brings a big GRTAGS and decrease at the writing speed.
		To avoid it, the records written to tag files are sorted beforehand.
		This function becomes effective if DBOP_SORTED_WRITE flag is specified
		for function dbop_open(). It uses an external POSIX sort program.

	Note: In the new method, temporary file doesn't become unnecessary.
	Because the external sort program also uses temporary files for its job.

	This small work greatly depends on the big work by Hideki IWAMOTO on February 1 2010.

April 27 2010, Shigo YAMAGUCHI

	* Changed the cache format (htags/cache.c) like follows:

	(1) Duplicate tag file
	     +--------------------+           +---------------------+
	     | <fid> <frequency>\0|        -> | <fid>\0<frequency>\0|
	     +--------------------+           +---------------------+
						'D/<fid>.html'
	(2) Tag definition
	     +---------------------------+    +----------------------+
	     |<line number> <file name>\0| -> |<line number>\0<fid>\0|
	     +---------------------------+    +----------------------+
						'S/<fid>.html#<line number>'

March 8 2010, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Changed the default parser of gtags(1) from gtags-parser(1) to libgloparser.a.
	  Config parameter 'use_builtin_parser' is not used any longer. If the config
	  variable GTAGS is defined then gtags(1) use the command layer parser specified
	  by the variable as well as before. But it is obsolete.

February 27 2010, Hideki IWAMOTO

	* Added support of function layer plugin parser.
	  Libtool 2.2.6b or later is required to build CVS version.

February 3 2010, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Use invisible temporary files instead of visible files (htags/assoc.c).

February 1 2010, Hideki IWAMOTO

	* Added built-in parser to improve the performance of making tag files.

	  When the built-in parser is used, the source files are parsed only once. 
	  The candidate of reference and other symbols are written to the temporary
	  file in Pass1, and read in Pass2.

	Pass 1:
	                             +-------+ 
	  source files =============>| gtags |============> GTAGS
	                             |       |============> GPATH
	                             |       | tag record
	                             |       |============> temporary file
	                             +-------+
	Pass 2:
	                 tag record  +-------+
	 temporary file ============>| gtags |============> GRTAGS
	                             |       |
	          GTAGS ============>|       |============> GSYMS
	                             +-------+

February 18 2009, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Rewrote the stack in libutil/find.c using the varray (libutil/varray.c)
	  instead of static array.
	* Changed gtags(1) not to do useless inspection for the files in the
	  directories which are listed in the skip list.

September 27 2008, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Changed the default cache size of DB library from 5M to 50M bytes.
	* Recovered the code in which pread/pwrite is used in BSD db library.
	  However, this code is not automatically used. To include the code,
	  please invoke configure script with the --with-pread-pwrite option.
	  The original code was written by Hideki IWAMOTO.

July 14 2008, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Changed gtags(1) to skip all files whoes first character of name is '.'.

	The following path was deleted from the DEFAULTSKIP in configure.ac, since new
	rule covers them.

	.notfunction
	.gdbinit
	.cvsrc
	.cvsignore
	.gitignore
	.cvspass
	.cvswrappers
	.deps/
	.snprj/
	.svn/
	.git/

April 21 2008, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gtags.vim: Stopped use of temporary file.

March 25 2008, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gtags.vim, gtags.pl: rewritten using new '--from-here' option of global(1).
	* Added htags/ghtml.cgi.tmpl.
	* Described the method of apache setting as a comment in htags/global.cgi.tmpl.in.
	* Modifications to allow symbolic link.
	  To realize it, normalize_path() and abs2rel() in libutil/abs2rel.c module is used
	  instead of realpath(3) library function.
	* gtags.el and gtags.vim are rewritten using new '--from-here' option of global(1).

October 26 2007, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Added file 'DONORS' which includes the list of donations to GNU GLOBAL.
	* Idset module: Performance improvement of idset module by using "unsigned long"
	  instead of "unsigned int" for bitmask. This is necessary to use 64 bit processor
	  effectively.

July 6 2007, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Migrated to GPLv3 and LGPLv3.
	* gtags.conf.in: Migrated to simple all-permissive license.

May 5 2007, by Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* New files: BOKIN_MODEL, BOKIN_MODEL_FAQ, DONORS

March 10 2007, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gtags.el: Added (provide 'gtags).
	* libutil/env.c: Use putenv(3) if it is available else use setenv(3).
	  Some systems don't have setenv(3).

January 29 2007, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Further compression of tag file (format version 5).
	  - Tag name is compressed.
	  - Each line number might be expressed as difference from the previous
	    line number except for the head.
	  	ex: 11,3,2 means '11 14 16'.
	  - In addition, successive line numbers are expressed as range (n1-n2).
	  	ex: 11-3 means '11 12 13 14'.

	* global(1): Sort filter was moved from the output filter to the input filter.

	   ( input )     |    ( m a i n )      |      ( o u t p u t )
	   gtagsop       |      global         |  tagsort   |  pathconvert
	  ---------------+---------------------+------------+--------------
	   expand tag +------------+             sort tag     convert path
				   |                 |
	       +-------------------------------------+
	       v                   v
	   sort tag        expand tag                         convert path

	  Instead, the processing of expanding tag was moved to the main module.
	  This improves the performance when compact format is used, since
	  sorting is done before expanding.

	  Recent architecture (GLOBAL-5.0 - 5.3)

	  +===========================================+
	  |global(write)->[sort filter]->[path filter]|->[stdout]
	  +===========================================+
	 
	  New architecture (GLOBAL-5.4 -)
	  
	  +===========================================+
	  |[sort filter]->global(write)->[path filter]|->[stdout]
	  +===========================================+

	* Removed some code which call the following method:
	  putenv utimes
		They are not natural method today.
	  pread pwrite
		They are risky since they are not used so much and are not
		often so tested.  It was found that the pread and pwrite in cygwin
		are buggy. Though it is not our business, user is not guilty too.
	  strdup
		It is not needed since we use check_strdup() instead.
	* Added some new modules.
	  pool - allocate and free memory for temporary use.
	  fileop - operation for opening and closing file.
	* Added some new methods.
	  strmake module - strcmp_withterm()
	* Removed some modules.
	  global/filter, libutil/tagsort
	* idset module:
	  - Added new functions idset_first(), idset_next() and idset_empty().
	  - Changed bitmask from char(8 bits) to integer (maybe 32 or 64 bits)
	    to improve performance.

November 20 2006, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gtags.el:
	  - gtags-make-complete-list is deprecated.
	    Added gtags-completing-gtags, gtags-completing-gsyms and gtags-completing.
	  - Throw away the output of gozilla in 'gtags-display-browser'.

August 8 2006, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* htags/fileindex.c: Rewritten using recursive call instead of stack structures.
	* gozilla.c: Fixed getURL() according to new GPATH.
	* Replaced malloc(), realloc() and stdup() with check_xxxx() functions.
	* Added icon files (icons/*png).

June 10 2006, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Recovered original texinfo file names (.txi -> .texi).

April 21 2006, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	Change in tag format:
	* Moved to new tag format. New tag format is as follows.
	  GTAGS (with compress option)
		<file id> <tag name> <line number> <compressed line image>
	  GRTAGS, GSYMS (with compact option)
		<file id> <tag name> <line number>[,...]
	* Now, GPATH has path names of not only source files but
	  also other text files. The following commands no longer
	  traverse file system. They read GPATH instead.
		global(1) with the --other option.
		htags(1) with the --other option.

	Change in architecture:
	* Changed the filtering architecture of global(1).
	
	  Old architecture (- GLOBAL-4.7.8)

	  process1          process2       process3
	  +=============+  +===========+  +===========+
	  |global(write)|->|sort filter|->|path filter|->[stdout]
	  +=============+  +===========+  +===========+
	
	  New architecture (GLOBAL-5.0 -)

	  1 process
	  +============================================+
	  |global(write) ->[sort filter]->[path filter]|->[stdout]
	  +============================================+
	
	  For the convenience of debugging, the old architecture is
	  also available. If macro EXTERNAL_FILTER is defined in filter.c
	  old architecture is selected.

	  The following options are also offered. (These options will be
	  deleted perhaps sooner or later.)

	    gtags --path={absolute|relative} --format={path|ctags|ctags-x|grep}
	    gtags --sort --format={path|ctags|ctags-x|grep} [--unique]
	    global --nofilter=[{path|sort}]
	    global --filter=[{path|sort}]
	    global --nosource
	
	  Moved the processing by which various formats are generated from
	  the main body of global(1) to the path filter. The main body
	  generates only two formats: path and ctags-x.
	  Path filter generates various formats which are given by the
	  --result=<format> option.

	Change in CGI mechanism:
	* The 'cgi-bin/' directory which generated by htags(1) doesn't
	  have any tag files. CGI script uses the tag files in the root
	  directory of a source project instead.

	New modules:
	* Added strhash module (strhash.c and strhash.h) to libutil.
	  Replaced the hash mechanism for compact format with this module.
	* Added xargs module (xargs.c and xargs.h) to libutil.
	  Replaced the xargs(1) like mechanism with this module.
	* Added pathconvert module (pathconvert.c and pathconvert.h) to libutil.
	  This module composes a part of an internal pipeline.
	* Added tagsort module (tagsort.c and tagsort.h) to libutil.
	  Replaced external sort filter (gnusort) with internal one
	  (tagsort module). Gnusort was removed. As a result, GLOBAL
	  became free from dependence on external commands.
	* Included GLIBC files obstack.c, obstack.h, hash-string.c and
	  hash-string.h.

	Internal options:
	* Removed two hidden options, --find and --other from gtags(1),
	  since they are no longer used.
	* Added new internal format 'ctags-xid' of global(1).
	  The anchor generation method of the global.cgi was changed.
	  Global.cgi script was modified to use the --result=ctags-xid
	  option of global(1)
	* Removed the -cc, -ccc, -cccc option of gtags(1).
	  These options were undocumented and only for testing.
	* Removed two hidden options, --find and --other from gtags(1),
	  since they are no longer used.

	Coding style:
	* End of support of K&R.
	* Changed function declarations to ANSI C style.

September 30 2005, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

        * Updated GNU Free Documentation License.(1.1->1.2)
        * Updated doc/texinfo.tex using texinfo-4.8.
        * BSD advertising clause was deleted, according to the declaration
          by UCB.
        * Added new module idset.
        * Added new function exec_line_limit() in env.c.
        * Added new function find_open_filelist() for the --file=xxx option.
          Find_read() and find_close() is shared by both find_open_filelist()
          and find_open().
        * Added new config option --with-db185-compat[=DIR].
          This is not for normal use, but for debugging.
        * Decreased use of popen() by moving the conversion from tabs to
          spaces into htags.
        * Reimplemented 'gtags --sort' without gnusort.
        * The default cache size was changed from 500000 to 5000000.
          Though I was assuming the machine equipped with 32-64MB,
          in a recent machine, even small one has 256-512MB memory.

May 12 2005, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

        * htags: New macro TOPDIR and SUBDIR added for readability.
        * htags: Quoted the "&" in attribute value.
        * Changed the address of FSF for each file.

April 19 2005, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* htags: Added new functions to generate anchor tag.
	  For <a href=*** ...>
	  - gen_href_begin_with_title_target()
	  - gen_href_begin_simple()
	  - gen_href_begin()
	  - gen_href_begin_with_title()
	  - gen_href_end()
	  For <a name=***>
	  - gen_name_number()
	  - gen_name_string()
	* htags, gtags-parser: Defined lex name generation rule.
	  - Change prefix * to *_.
	  - New lex name generation rule.
	  - New macro definition (LEXTEXT, LEXLENG, ...))
	* Added new macro STATIC_STRBUF(sb).
	* Added new macros (PART_TAG, PART_LNO, PART_PATH, PART_LINE).
	* strbuf.[ch]: Memory management was made more efficient.
	* Added const prefix to char * if it is suitable.
	* Install gtags.el into the $datadir/gtags directory instead of
	  the site lisp directory because the installation procedure
	  fails when the site lisp directory doesn't exist.

February 26 2005, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

        * Required version of autotools was updated.
          - autoconf 2.59
          - automake 1.9.3
          Configure.ac was modified according to the new style.
        * Install gtags.el into the site lisp directory.
        * When child process terminates abnormally, the program
          execution is ended.
        * The gctags directory was renamed to gtags-parser according to
          the renaming of the command.
        * gtags-parser: Modified to use a switch table for switching
          language.

November 11 2004, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

        * Assembly language parser rewritten using Yacc.
        * libutil/strmake.c: strtrim() added.
        * libutil/varray.c added.

        Decrease in dependency to external commands:
        * The sed(1), sort(1) and find(1) are not necessary any longer.
        * The support of find(1) as a method of directory traversing
          was ended. As a result, dirent(3) became indispensable.
          The configuration phase was changed like follows:

                if dirent(3) exist then
                        use dirent(3)
                else if find(1) exist then
                        use find(1)
                else
                        ERROR
                        |
                        v
                if dirent(3) exist then
                        use dirent(3)
                else
                        ERROR
        * Htags.pl was removed completely. Therefore, the --date, --pwd,
          --write and --scandb option of gtags(1) which was used internally
          by htags.pl, were removed.
        * Includes GNU sort as part of GLOBAL package.
          This solves following troubles:
          - A certain operating system has another 'sort' command
            that specification is different from GNU sort. Unluckily,
            the command is often invoked for GLOBAL.
          - Multi-language version of sort is often very slow. Since GLOBAL
            doesn't support multi-language, the slowness is quite meaningless.
          - In the past, the specification of sort command was changed.

October 6 2004, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* libutil/langmap.c, langmap.h added.
	  Config variable 'langmap' will be added officially sooner or later.
	* gctags/asm_res.in and htags/asm.l added.
	* fileindex.c: makeincludeindex() was cut out from makefileindex()
	  for statistic.
	* The priority of the method selection for directory traversing
	  was changed like follows:

		if find(1) exist then
			use find(1)
		else
			use dirent(3)
			|
			v
		if dirent(3) exist then
			use dirent(3)
		else if find(1) exist then
			use find(1)
		else
			ERROR

	* gozilla: removed the Win32 version of sendbrowser, using a direct
	  call to ShellExecute (since the browser probably isn't on the path,
	  and -remote doesn't seem to work on Windows).
	* htags/src2html.c: Modified to use a switch table for switching
	  language.

August 26 2004, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Moved function now() from gtags.c to libutil/date.c.
	* htags: Changed so that the path passed to CGI might be encoded to %xx.

	* die.c: New function sethandler() and warning() added.
	* gctags/reserved.pl: The use of the --key-positions option of gperf(1)
	  was stopped. We need gperf-3.0.1 instead.

June 1 2004, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	  AUTHORS COPYING ChangeLog FAQ INSTALL LICENSE NEWS README THANKS
	  globash.rc gtags.conf gtags.el gtags.pl gtags.vim nvi-1.79-gtags.diff

Oct 3 2003, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gtags.conf.in, libutil/conf.h.in: Now gtags.conf and conf.h
	  are generated by autoconf.
	* The priority of the method of directory traverse was reversed again,
	  because, in some GNU/Linux, struct dirent has a member d_type but
	  always return 0. As the result, if find(1) is available then use it,
	  otherwise use dirent(3).

July 2 2003, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* gctags: If you want to build this parser from original source in
	  CVS repository then it is necessary to install flex(1) and gperf(1)
	  in your environment. (Since both of them are GNU software,
	  you can get them from GNU ftp site.)
	* reserved.pl: Generate C and Perl code for locating reserved words.

	  between find(1) version and dirent(3) version.
	* htags.in: Remove tag name and line image from cache record.
	  This made cache file smaller.
	* htags.in: Stop using anchor db. Up to now, only gtags had called
	  the parser. But hereafter, the parser will be called by both
	  gtags and htags.
	* global.c: About the -g option, implementation using grep + xargs
	  was removed.
	* libutil/find.c: The priority of the method of directory traverse
	  was reversed. If dirent(3) is available, then use it to traverse
	  directory tree. Otherwise use find(1).
	* configure.ac: --with-cflags=[=VAL] was removed.
	  Please use ./configure CFLAGS=VAL instead.
	* reconf.sh: --configure, --make and --install option added.

March 29 2003, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* libutil: linetable.[ch] added.

July 4 2002, Shigio YAMAGUCHI

	* Cygwin support code added.
	  David Aspinwall ported Global-3.44 into cygwin32 environment.
	  I referred his code but I didn't use it in as is style, because it
